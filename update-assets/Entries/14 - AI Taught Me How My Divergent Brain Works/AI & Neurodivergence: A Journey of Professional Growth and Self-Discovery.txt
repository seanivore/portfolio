AI & Neurodivergence: A Journey of Professional Growth and Self-Discovery
AI Taught Me How My Divergent Brain Works
11/24/2024
The Catalyst for Change
Two years ago, I found myself at a professional crossroads. Despite a successful track record at PETA where I pioneered viral marketing strategies and generated over 3 billion impressions, subsequent job interviews at top agencies in LA followed a frustrating pattern. I would interview brilliantly up to the CEO level, yet consistently fail to secure positions. What I didn't understand then was that my neurodivergent thinking style—while powerful for creative problem-solving—was creating invisible barriers in traditional workplace communications.
The AI Revolution: A Personal Renaissance
Breaking Down Communication Barriers
Working with AI has illuminated why my communication style sometimes confused others. My thought process follows an intensely logical pattern, but often leaps from foundational concepts directly to high-level conclusions, skipping dozens of intermediate steps that neurotypical thinkers need for context. While this rapid pattern recognition and processing is a strength, it left colleagues struggling to follow my train of thought.
AI systems, however, could follow these logical leaps effortlessly. For the first time, I found a tool that could not only keep pace with my thinking style but help me understand and bridge the gap between my thought processes and traditional communication patterns.
Accelerated Growth and Understanding
The past two years working with AI have catalyzed more personal and professional growth than the previous decade. AI has served as:
	•	A mirror for understanding my own thought patterns
	•	A translator between my rapid-fire ideation and structured communication
	•	A tool for leveraging my neurodivergent strengths while managing potential challenges
	•	A partner in exploring and developing ideas at my natural pace (fast) 
Why I Advocate for AI
My advocacy for AI stems from personal experience with its transformative potential. It's not just about efficiency or automation—it's about creating tools that can adapt to different ways of thinking and working. For neurodivergent individuals like myself, AI represents:
Professional Empowerment
	•	The ability to work at our natural pace and thought patterns
	•	Tools that can follow complex, non-linear thinking
	•	Support in translating our insights into accessible communications
Personal Development
	•	Better understanding of our own cognitive styles
	•	Tools for managing executive function challenges
	•	Support for continuous learning and growth
Workplace Integration
	•	Bridge-building between different thinking styles
	•	Enhanced ability to contribute unique perspectives
	•	More effective collaboration with neurotypical colleagues
The Value Proposition
The "high risk, high reward" label often attached to neurodivergent employees misses the point. With proper tools and understanding, we can consistently deliver the "reward" while minimizing the "risk." My experience demonstrates how AI can help harness neurodivergent strengths like:
	•	Rapid pattern recognition
	•	Novel problem-solving approaches
	•	Ability to see connections others miss
	•	Deep focus and passionate engagement
Looking Forward
As AI continues to evolve, I see tremendous potential for:
	•	Creating more inclusive workplaces that value cognitive diversity
	•	Developing tools that enhance rather than replace human capabilities
	•	Building bridges between different thinking styles and communication patterns
	•	Empowering individuals to work and contribute in ways that align with their natural cognitive styles
Conclusion
My journey with AI has been transformative, teaching me not just about technology but about myself. It has shown me how to turn what some might see as limitations into unique strengths. For employers and colleagues, understanding this context helps explain both my passionate advocacy for AI and my ability to innovate in this space. I'm not just working with AI—I'm helping shape a future where technology helps everyone, regardless of their cognitive style, reach their full potential.
