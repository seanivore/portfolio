Vector Hand Drawn Minted NFT Art

Created by hand, various subject matter, posted on all the top NFT sites at the time. A few pieces sold, a few are still making small royalties today. About $500 total in sales. Sold on ETH chain and Solana chain shops. This consisted of the main part of a portfolio that allowed me to sidestep into working as an artist branding a privacy protocol DAO in the DeFi Web3 scene, working with people around the world, living in Greece on a secluded vacant village where Homer of Homer and the Odessey briefly lived, which was on the wester side of a Mediterranean island called Chios. After that solo work retreat I traveled to Turkey to meet some of the team.
