Github Pages Portfolio Redesign Project
https://seanivore.github.io/portfolio/ 

1. An original version is live with a handful of entries. 
2. I have the bulk of the rest of the entries prepared. 
3. We have almost finished all necessary redesign tasks. 

I'm getting rate limited by Anthropic like crazy and need to finish this thing, and so I'm wondering if you can help me. My only coding experience has been with AI and I've made some MCPs and a makeshift "Projects" RAG that allowed us to use API and avoid rate limits before all the MCPs pushed us back to the OS app. Most projects I'm very much looking to learn as we go, but I am desperately trying to expedite the rest of this redesign and get it live so that I can start sending it out. Let me share with you its status, our intention, and out we have prepared for the page building.

Redesign Project Tasks 
=====

PAGE TEMPLATE WITH RULES AND GUIDE: 

Initially this was intended for Cline so that after our updates it could literally just run through creating all the pages without any human necessary. It did great on the first version, so the following was our fool-proof plan for perfection in the new design. 

We created a template.html document intended to display and explain how to create any page layout needed using a versatile, modular system we created. All of the classes, modifiers, and variables have been identified and named and tested. 

/Users/seanivore/Dropbox/Development/portfolio-2025/pages/template.html

That ~/Dev/portfolio-2025/pages/ folder is where our future pages are intended to live. 

The CSS styles, intended to be a single shared document, was too large Claude's whole code edit process. So we have base and components separated for now. 

/Users/seanivore/Dropbox/Development/portfolio-2025/base.css

/Users/seanivore/Dropbox/Development/portfolio-2025/components.css

While all of that was complete, the template.html page's background / hero with perspective motion effect got somehow messed up when we started making homepage changes before updating the name of the homepage class to .masthead. 

/Users/seanivore/Dropbox/Development/portfolio-2025/assets/js/parallax.js 

We had a markdown where we started building out an SOP and guide with rules. Ideally we were setting things up so that Cline wouldn't need to make any new classes. I saw something about "Conventions.md" files for Aider so I placed them all here. 

/Users/seanivore/Dropbox/Development/portfolio-2025/CONVENTIONS.md

Note that I have a subfolder "workspace-to-be-deleted" that I have not been pushing to Github or tracking with git. 

=====
Placing a possible break here — in case we want to fix template first
It would also be ideal to finalize the CONVENTIONS.md guide
=====

Our other main goal was to make the category tags on our entries into functional UI for filtering entries on the homepage, and to inform a "related entries" section on each entry page. 

Additionally we wanted to create homepage content tiles that were more visual. 

Most of this has been achieved! The tag UI buttons are placed in the masthead. Their logic works and shuffles our tiles. (We added the tiles for prepared posts we had to be able to test it.) The masthead was redesigned. We also finished redesigning the content tiles. 

=====
Here is what we were going to do next. 
=====

The next task was to weight the tags (3 primary per page and 6 secondary per page) and create a simple algorithm that would find the two pages that has the most similar tags shared with the project page the User is currently on, displaying them above the footer of each project entry page. 

The homepage had an old styles file that was to be simplified and condensed into our other file(s). This is a secondary potential place to start that would fit well with fixing the template.html page. 

=====
Reviewing HTML documents and condensing old CSS file(s) into one. 
=====

Our homepage with new tiles, followed by what remains of the old CSS file, much of which has been added to our other CSS files already. 

'index.html'
/Users/seanivore/Dropbox/Development/portfolio-2025/index.html

'style.css' 
/Users/seanivore/Dropbox/Development/portfolio-2025/style.css

Tag UI Button Functionality 'script.js' 
/Users/seanivore/Dropbox/Development/portfolio-2025/assets/js/script.js

=====
1. Perhaps we could start by fixing the template HTML
2. Then condense all our CSS files into one single shared CSS file. 
=====

Looking ahead, after that we'd want to use the tiles to create the "related post" functionality. We might need to first create some of the actual entry pages. 

All entry pages that are ready to be created have a TXT file that provides all assets — the image media is uploaded to Github and listed as a raw URL. There is meta information, any relatively well structure page copy — however I trust the LLM coding to make any alterations to the text and layout needed. We just want to be consistent. 

=====
Project Entry Asset Pages
=====

Entries with Prepared Asset Documents

1. The "position" number of entries needs to be integrated into the homepage layout so that the default is reverse chronological order; the lowest at the bottom and highest at the top. 

2. Entries are listed below via their asset txt file, in which you will find the necessary meta information, copy, and media to create the entry. All media has been pushed to Github to provide raw URLs in the document. 

3. The name of the asset's project folder — also included in the file name of every asset — is intended to be the HTML file name for this entry. This ensures that it will be the slug in the website's URL.

=====
1. Once the pages are added
2. And the final tag UI "related post" functionality is set up
3. All left on my list is fixing the URL to remove .html
4. Taking down the old portfolio that is still live
5. Publishing the new portfolio
=====

Publishing New Design 
- Old version is still live; take down 
- Publish new version to Github Pages
- Set up Jekyll if not set up; GitHub Pages uses by default
- Change default URL; ".html" removed from all URLs 

=====

THAT IS ALL! I hope I'm not missing something and I hope I laid that out clearly.
