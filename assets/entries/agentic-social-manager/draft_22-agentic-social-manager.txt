This one has a great slug and would be good to use accordingly. Collecting visual examples across brands and media efforts. Some images here are therefore intentionally reused, to tell a different story.

Automated scenario that found relevant images for what was needed to post from our ArtMovementMuseum Print Shop. There were various staged images, framed close-ups, and then just image files for the posts to find and include as needed. This automation did that leg work but then took it a step further by making sure the images were cropped and sized all the same before posting to any social media sites. Then the images would pull from another database that had used vision AI to review the images and, using context provided generatively produced a caption that would work well for the post. Using those captions, as there were various created depending on the social platform, it then posted the images and doubled back to save the permalink, sending it off to our AI assistant to save as an embedding with the details of what images there were, what date it was, what the context was that the post was marketed and framed as, what the caption was, etc. This information was essential because the AI later was tasked with producing the posts and was able to ensure our posts were consistent but also never reusing images too soon if ever.

This was the automated production of image posts with generatively written text to promote articles about gemstones in our Austrofluenced brand. It pulled from another database that had content written after a vision AI reviewed the image and the article it was promoting. This flow used an API service to have the text designed onto the image and then was saved into its new, proper, database, finishing by notifying a Discord server, which would trigger the next steps in the flow.

Any good marketer knows that when you post promotions you want to use analytics and tracked links so that you can determine what is working best and what isn't working. This was a scenario that would create these tracked links on the fly for all social media platforms, adding them back to the database for the next automation to pull from when promoting, or to add to our 'Links" mobile page that would stay linked in the profile of instagram.

These were automations to promote the lookbook multiple times every week with fresh angles. Specifically here the SEO Title and Summary text which has been generatively created based on our assistant AI knowing what had been used in the past and what other potential angles could be used to frame the content successfully. It also updated the thumbnail and pulled a version that was cropped for instagram. This flow, along with the preceding flows that prepared the details used in this posting automation, were essential for continuously promoting the lookbook which, unlike our other blogs from the Astrofluenced brand, was created once per quarter and not weekly. Being a much larger project there were many, many ways and many images to post to promote the lookbooks.

These two images were part of a very powerful engagement flow that helped grow the Style Spectrum brand quickly. In the first flow, new posts from the influencers we followed which had been saved via permalink to a database, first downloaded the image then had vision AI review it and its context — it could see the image, the caption and top comments, though the idea here was to be one of the first to post. The AI used that information to generatively write a caption using a specially crafted system message that ensured it used our brands hip voice. Because of Meta (Facebook/Instagram) API limitations that proposed comment was saved to a database that provided the actual permalink to the post — you can see there were quite a few of these via the second image of some of our automations. Then a human was able to come in a few times a day and very easily look at the comment, adjust if needed, though if anyone has used Claude with a strong system message that was perfected, you know this is often rarely needed, then just by hitting Notion's UI button to copy the caption and then clicking the link URL next to it, the webpage would open right to the post so that you could very easily add the comment. 

This flow was especially powerful because, not only did it make us look wildly active on social media, Claude was rather funny which made accounts that saw the post later and commented as well like our post and end up on our page. Additionally, Claude would also recognize nuanced things about the post. Since each post's influencer had it's on automated flow, we were able to add in information about what kind of art the influencer posted, and could even update over time our notes based on what worked best and got them to respond or like our comment. This was huge because Claude often noted things in the image about what the artist was using as inspiration or even what various artists from history made aesthetically similar works — all of this information made for comments on images that were both engaging for being hip and witty, but also incredibly informed far more than any one potential hire social media manager could ever compete with, particularly at the speed that Claude could.
