This project demonstrated the power of AI-driven social media management across multiple brands and platforms, ultimately generating over 55,000 brand impressions during a 6-month campaign period. Our most significant success came through Style Spectrum's Instagram presence, where individual posts reached up to 17,200 impressions, showing how automated content production could achieve meaningful engagement at scale.

CAPTION: Images selected according to need, then edited and resized in the same automation, before being posted to social media platforms using captions created by AI that knows the exact context and has seen the image. The post permalink and other information is then saved back in the database so that it can later be added to embeddings for analytics tracking. 

The journey began with our ArtMovementMuseum Print Shop automation, where we created a sophisticated system that went beyond simple post scheduling. The AI would identify ideal images from our collection, handle proper cropping and sizing for each platform, and generate contextually appropriate captions using vision AI analysis. By capturing post permalinks and storing them with rich contextual data, we created a growing knowledge base that helped ensure our content remained fresh and never repetitive.

CAPTION: The weekly automation that created the top performing image post.

CAPTION: A bit of a surprise at first, but the audience was very fond of posts with long captions and multiple images. Basically a post with a lot of information packed in every corner. 

The Astrofluenced brand showcased the versatility of our automation system through various content types. Our top-performing Facebook image post, heavy with text and containing four versions of the same image with different set on each slide, pictured above, featured modern magic and "Witches" content, with copy generatively produced using automation that referenced daily astrology charts and interpreted archetypal energies. The images, created using Adobe Firefly's AI generation, supported weekly content about planetary hours, crystal recommendations, and beneficial colors based on current energies.

CAPTION: With so many different pieces of content to keep track of on so many different source social platforms, an automation that prepared a tracked and shortened link with all the necessary details added directly to the same database that the promotions would publish from was essential.

CAPTION: Sent to a service that sends back the rendered video via Webhook. 

One of our most complex automations powered our crystal content videos [img-08-agentic-social-manager.webp]. The process began with astrology data entry, triggering an AI analysis that informed crystal selection. This data then fed into another AI system for copywriting and image generation. Finally, an API service automatically edited the video using a template, with cloud rendering taking mere seconds before automated distribution.

For our metaphysical content series [img-09-agentic-social-manager.webp], we created angelic-themed visuals using generative AI, with captions crafted by vision AI analysis of the completed images. This approach allowed us to maintain both visual consistency and engaging messaging across multiple platforms.

The Style Spectrum brand demonstrated sophisticated content curation [img-10-agentic-social-manager.webp], leveraging our tagged and embedded collection data to group thematically related prints. The AI generated staged presentations and crafted engaging captions – even making clever Harry Potter references that resonated with our audience.

Perhaps most impressively, our celebrity content tracking automation [img-11-agentic-social-manager.webp] showed its sophistication when it identified and repurposed a Beyoncé post, with the AI making an insightful connection between the image's alien aesthetic and Aquarius energy, creating timely astrological content that capitalized on current trends.
