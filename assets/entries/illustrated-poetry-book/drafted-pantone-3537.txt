Digital Illustration for Poetry Publication 

Illustrations for a book of LGTBQ poetry written, edited, and published as PANTONE 3537 UP authored by Sean August Horvath. The drawings are inspired by classical ancient Greek sculpture, photographs of lovers past, memories from relationships. 

My first pieces of truly public art was a book of love poetry. Cathartic. Too young to know better than to let myself fall so completely.

In those early 20s years I was always searching for a "great love" to make happen by my late 20s. Not until my 30s did I realize that I am the great love I needed to find — for myself. For the work I do, for the projects I find myself fixated on, and for the legacy I will build. 

Difficult to let go, so I wrote it out of me. I shared every detail until I felt no more. It is sappy and I'm not entirely sure I'd even recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 years old — around the age I wish I had a book like this — of poetry written from a perspective I could benefited from observing a decade earlier. Perhaps if I had I'd not have spent so many years in my 20s feeling too much. 

In completing the book I drew an illustration for every poem.

Since publication in 2018 I've sold a hundred or so copies — still every few months another will be purchased from a local consignment shop, even one this quarter in 2024. 

I did a bit of digging after publication and pitched to some blog, getting a pick-up here and there.

"A chronological, lyrical expression of the emotional tidal wave that crashes and destroys all after you fall for someone "too fast." What a hopeless romantic can fell in just two months. Oh, and you're gay and living in Los Angeles." — the back cover of this self-published book of gay poetry states, PANTONE 3537 UP. Truly it is incredibly sappy and hard to read in retrospect. But I wrote it for two reasons: 1. I had to write all that I was feeling out of me, and 2. I wish I had gay poetry about feeling too much when I was going through puberty growing up with no one else gay around me. It was this feeling that prompted me to do some digging to research publications that write about poetry and other self-published books. I sent a press release, after processing through many replies, one day woke up to a Google Alert that one has been published. The write up is about as simple as this intentionally simple, but syllabic, poems. Nonetheless, it felt like success.‍

"Shout-out to hope — you're forever cruel and tragic and beautiful." Self published book of gay love poetry picked up by press.
