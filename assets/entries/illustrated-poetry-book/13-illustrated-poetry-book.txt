A self-published book of LGBTQ+ poetry featuring original digital illustrations, combining classical Greek sculptural influences with contemporary personal narrative. Written, illustrated, and published under my authorship as Sean August Horvath, the book has maintained consistent sales since its 2018 publication, including recent purchases in 2024.

The illustrations draw inspiration from classical Greek sculpture while incorporating contemporary elements from personal photography and memories. This fusion creates a unique visual narrative that complements the poetry's themes of love, growth, and self-discovery.

Personal Note:
Writing this book fulfilled dual purposes: personal catharsis and creating the kind of resource I wished existed during my own coming-of-age journey. While the poems capture the raw emotions of early-20s love, the project's true value lies in its contribution to LGBTQ+ youth literature and its demonstration of how personal experience can be transformed into professional creative work.
