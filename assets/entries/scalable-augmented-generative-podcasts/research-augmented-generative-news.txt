[Image with manifesto text: A.S. Daily Polytechnic Briefings
We live in an era of consolidating centralization; as Artificial Intelligence increasingly brings value to the product and not the producer, ASD's Polytechnic Briefings is strategically positioned to disrupt the status quo.
We call for a movement: escaping our silos and turning their walled gardens into botanical urban splendor. We place technological knowledge into the hands of those it directly influences - out of the academic ivory and into the minds and hearts of global citizens. Like the great storytellers before us, we weave technically complex concepts into engaging dialogue, cultivating a culture of cross-disciplinary curiosity and connection.
Extraordinary. There is no other word for the progress unfolding across all disciplines right now.
You live in the most enlightening period of human history, yet towers and golden stairways through skyscrapers lay vacant beside vagrants, throwing shade into the very essence of your being. While crisis-focused media fixates on carefully crafted headlines designed to divide, we shine a solar maximum on humanity's ingenuity born from the womb of the hopeful.
We wield words that decentralize the post neo-libertarian corporate conglomerates that coagulate what belongs to the people. Technology will be ours. We build bridges, connecting cultures with knowledge and smiling eyes.
Don't underestimate yourself - knowledge is power. Our weekly synthesis of 100+ science and breaking news articles across 20 industries, consumed in an hour a day, will challenge their isolation of expertise. Together, we nurture collaborative innovation and craft the world our children desire.] img-14-research-augmented-generative-news.webp
