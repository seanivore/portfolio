Quantum Leap in Content Strategy
How We Gained 8,000 Views in Under Two Weeks
In the rapidly evolving world of digital content, standing out is more challenging than ever. But what if I told you that by blending quantum computing, fashion, and art, we've managed to create a content strategy that's not just unique, but also incredibly effective? Here's how we've achieved exponential growth in such a short timespan, and our innovative approach behind it.


I question this later on as well — in that we have 24 topics and I just happened to share the quantum image with you. I think you’ll better understand as we proceed. 
Numbers Speak Volumes


Before diving into our strategy, a quick overview of our results thus far which represent metrics specifically for Oct 4, 2024 to today, Oct 19, 2024, acknowledging that Youtube views grow over time and videos don’t always take off right after posting.


* 50 episodes scheduled, 44 published (3 of which published today)
* 8,000 views
* 94 subscribers, with a 135% increase (54 new subscribers) in the past week alone
* 24 scheduled topics spread across 5 days, each getting a new podcast


These numbers aren't just statistics; they're a testament to the power of innovative content creation using today’s cutting edge technology, and strategic promotion creation of promotional assets
Our Quantum Leap: Blending Tech, Fashion, and Art
The core of this success has been  a unique approach combining complex technological topics with visually on-trend, captivating thumbnails inspired by fashion and historic art movements. Here's how we're doing it:


1. Quantum Computing for Business Leaders — We're taking intricate topics like logical qubits and real-world applications of quantum computers and presenting them in a way that's accessible and engaging for business professionals.

After learning about NotebookLM we immediately identified niche's topics where the members of the demographic are either struggling to find news on their niche or don't have time to do research on their own. We set out to create all of these Podcasts, that would lead to Newsletters, and eventually a very valuable collection of industry specific data to be leveraged both in production of future applications and for marketing and advertiser use.

2. Fashion-Forward Visuals — Our thumbnails aren't your typical tech imagery. We're drawing inspiration from fashion lookbooks, creating a visual language that's both unexpected and captivating in the tech space.

You can't watch a Youtube video today without seeing comments that complain about "clickbait thumbnails" — we created a process where we could capitalize on our other project assets, and then later double back to increase performance wherever we deemed most beneficial.

3. Art-Inspired Themes — Each of our content series is themed around different art movements, adding an extra layer of depth and visual interest to our channel.

These tie back to a print shop we run that focuses specifically on production of historically accurate artwork. As art is a visual language that expresses both mood and more, it seemed a logical connection

This cross-pollination of ideas from different verticals has allowed us to create content that's not just informative, but also visually compelling and culturally relevant. 


And optimizes overall flow of both this vertical as well as the other vertical where the content had been borrowed from.
The Strategy Behind the Thumbnails
Our approach to thumbnails is as strategic as it is creative:
   1. Subtle Start — We begin with less aggressive thumbnails to establish credibility and avoid initial pushback against "clickbait."

These are crafted more specifically for the type of listener we, more broadly, believe our brand will resonate with.

   2. Data-Driven Optimization — For our top-performing content, we circle back and amp up the thumbnail design, leveraging the audience we've already built.

Or if we have reason to believe that lower performing content isn't getting the attention it deserves.

   3. Variety is Key — We maintain a mix of bold and subtle thumbnails across our channel, catering to different viewer preferences and keeping our content feed visually diverse.

Perhaps most importantly, we always leave the door open to experimentation — key to any social media success.

This method allows us to balance audience growth with maintaining the integrity of our brand and content.
The Art and Science of AI-Driven Content Creation
Our approach goes far beyond simple content scheduling. We've developed a sophisticated AI-driven process that merges quantum computing topics with art and fashion, creating a truly unique content experience.

I'm not sure if it is intentional but just wanted to mention that it is quite larger than this (there being 24 topics) -- though if it is intentional for intrigue, I get it.
From Fashion Lookbooks to Quantum Computing
Our journey began with an innovative approach to creating fashion lookbooks:
      1. AI-Generated Narratives — We use AI to craft stories based on astrological seasons, creating relatable characters and experiences.
      2. Archetype Profiling — These narratives inform character archetypes, which we then match with art history movements to capture moods and influences, ensuring our fashion design to be relatable and solve real world problems of everyday people.
      3. AI Collaboration — Multiple AI systems work together though automations using API to creating narratives, selecting aesthetic elements, and reviewing each other's work.
      4. Outfit Generation — The final output is used by AI to craft detailed outfit descriptions for each character and milestone in the narrative.
We've adapted this process for our quantum computing content:
      1. Topic as Narrative — Instead of astrological seasons, we use quantum computing topics as our narrative base.

Again, there are 24 different topics. I just happened to share one.

      2. Visual Representation — We apply the same principle of matching archetypes and art movements to create visually striking thumbnails that represent complex quantum concepts.
      3. AI-Human Collaboration — While AI generates initial drafts, our team refines and redesigns them for the final product, ensuring a perfect blend of innovation and human creativity.
This cross-pollination of ideas and processes allows us to create content that's not just informative, but visually captivating and culturally relevant.
Navigating Challenges and Learning Curves
Implementing this ambitious strategy hasn't been without its challenges:
         1. Scale and Balance — Producing 24 podcasts a week is an enormous undertaking. It's been a constant lesson in finding balance and optimizing processes.
         2. Continuous Improvement — Every obstacle we've faced has been an opportunity to increase the value of our end product. This mindset has been crucial in navigating the learning curves of this new age of production.
         3. Future-Proofing — Our process always includes elements that may not be immediately necessary but will be valuable in the future. This forward-thinking approach, while sometimes challenging due to rapidly changing technology, ensures we're always prepared for the next innovation.
Audience Engagement and PR Strategy
While our content is still in its early stages, we're already seeing engagement, particularly around more controversial topics. Our approach to audience interaction draws from experience in managing high-stakes conversations:
         1. Encouraging Feedback — We actively push for comments on our most thought-provoking content.
         2. Conversation Control — When dealing with potentially negative feedback, we employ PR strategies to reclaim the conversation, always aiming to keep our brand in the best light.
         3. Expanding Reach — As we finalize our automated processes, we're beginning to push our content beyond YouTube podcasts, opening up new avenues for engagement.
Looking Ahead: The Future of AI-Driven Content
Our journey so far has been exhilarating, but it's only the beginning. As we continue to refine our processes and expand our reach, we're excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. 
         1. Further AI Integration — We're constantly exploring new ways to leverage AI in our content creation process, always with an eye on maintaining the human touch that makes our content unique.

Also because OMG do we have an awesomely long list that we'll start knocking out of the ballpark once we have agents from the frontier model AI companies we work directly with.

         2. Cross-Industry Applications — The strategies we've developed have potential applications far beyond quantum computing and fashion. We're eager to explore how this approach can benefit other industries.
         3. Scaling Up — As our audience grows, we're preparing to scale our content production while maintaining the high quality our viewers have come to expect.

FWIW — we will be separating out topics from the 24 grouping now under one umbrella when they have enough of a following to be able to determine how exactly their audience differs from the more general audience that brand's start out with. This will allow for more rapid grow within the industry sector's audience list, making that data far more valuable in years to come.
Adaptable, Nimble, Agile
In this rapidly evolving landscape of AI and content creation, adaptability and innovation are key. Our experience demonstrates that by thinking creatively, embracing new technologies, and always keeping the audience in mind, it's possible to achieve remarkable results in a short time.

One of the things I think about the most is which projects to take on that are almost guaranteed to be made easier by AI but not replaced by AI — something I see happen constantly with AI startups building AI apps. It is like that Steve Jobs quote "When we come up with a new media, we tend to fall back." We those who fall back get their business models usurped by AI frontier tech companies as they grow. But as long as we continue to ensure that we are not falling back and instead are creating novel use of the new mediums, then we should be safe, and only benefit from AI developments. 


Perhaps also worth noting that I spend a GREAT deal of time talking strategy with AI regarding what technology is coming and when. This way we can plan our projects accordingly. Many of them right now are waiting of that new feature AI is sure to release in time.
