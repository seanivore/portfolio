FAQ: Navigating the Climate Crisis in the Age of AI
1. Why is it so difficult to create effective regulations for climate change adaptation?
The dynamic and unpredictable nature of climate change makes it difficult to design regulations that can adequately address future challenges. The uncertainty surrounding specific impacts and the constantly shifting landscape creates a "moving target" that's hard to pin down with fixed rules. This can lead to decision paralysis, political roadblocks, and regulations that become quickly outdated.
2. Is it logical to completely abandon high-risk coastal areas?
While radical, retreating from high-risk areas could significantly reduce immediate risks and financial burdens associated with recurring disasters. It might also accelerate environmental recovery and incentivize greener lifestyles. However, the logistical and social implications of mass relocation are enormous and would require careful consideration.
3. Is relying on public opinion shifts to drive climate action an effective strategy?
History suggests that societies often need a major crisis or tipping point to trigger large-scale change. Waiting for such a point with climate change is extremely risky, as irreversible damage may occur before sufficient action is taken. We need proactive measures that go beyond relying solely on public opinion shifts.
4. Why are the seemingly small, incremental actions we've taken for climate change insufficient?
Incremental actions, while important, may not match the scale and urgency of the climate crisis. The risk is that by the time we realize these steps are inadequate, we may be forced into even more drastic, unplanned actions with far greater consequences. We need to plan for potentially radical changes now rather than waiting for them to become unavoidable.
5. How can we bridge the disconnect between scientific understanding and public/political action on climate change?
The gap between scientific knowledge and action stems from challenges in communicating complex scientific information, psychological biases that prioritize immediate concerns over long-term threats, and political systems that often struggle with long-term planning.
6. Could AI play a role in bridging this gap?
AI's ability to process vast amounts of data and generate accurate models could be crucial in understanding and responding to climate change. However, the potential for AI-driven insights to influence policy decisions raises ethical questions about transparency, accountability, and human control.
7. Is there a way to reconcile the need for rapid climate action with ethical considerations and democratic principles?
This is a core challenge of our time. Authoritarian solutions, while tempting, carry significant risks and ethical implications. The key lies in finding ways to accelerate action within democratic frameworks. This may require reforming existing institutions, strengthening science communication, and developing innovative policy approaches that can handle long-term global challenges.
8. Is transhumanism a potential solution to the limitations of human decision-making in the face of climate change?
Transhumanism, the enhancement of human capabilities through technology, presents a radical but potentially viable path. It could address limitations in human cognition and decision-making, enabling faster adaptation and understanding of complex AI-driven solutions. However, the ethical and societal implications of transhumanism are profound and require careful consideration before widespread adoption.

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,320
That's become our reality.


16
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,440
It's become the new normal almost.


17
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:21,740
Yeah.


18
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,100
And that frustration you talk about.


19
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,200
About the lack of action.


20
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,580
Mm-hmm.


21
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,000
I get it.


22
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,200
It's fascinating isn't it.


23
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,680
Yeah.


24
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,260
This disconnect between you know


25
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,660
the urgency of the science.


26
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,200
Right.


27
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,720
And just the pace of societal change.


28
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,320
Yeah.


29
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,500
It makes you wonder.


30
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,459
Like it's a pattern.


31
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,560
We've seen this throughout history


32
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,360
when you think about it.


33
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,000
Right.


34
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,139
Major shifts.


35
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:42,700
Yeah.


36
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,200
The fall of empires.


37
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,639
Economic revolutions.


38
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:48,080
Even just the emergence of new technologies.


39
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,500
These things often only happen.


40
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,380
Yeah.


41
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,740
After a significant tipping point.


42
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,720
Mm-hmm.


43
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,340
A real crisis that forces everyone to adapt.


44
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,200
It's like we need that kick in the pants


45
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,060
to get going.


46
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,459
Right.


47
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:03,939
And so the question is with climate change


48
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,099
are we going to wait.


49
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:05,639
Yeah.


50
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:06,739
Until it's too late.


51
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,879
You know is that tipping point going to come too late.


52
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,040
And it's almost ironic.


53
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,839
You know.


54
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:12,279
Yeah.


55
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:14,019
The way you pointed out how people


56
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,839
are moving to the very places.


57
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:16,519
Yes.


58
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,180
Most vulnerable to climate change.


59
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,839
Right.


60
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:19,660
Like the southeast.


61
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,559
It's wild.


62
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,260
Right.


63
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,919
With the hurricanes getting stronger all the time.


64
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:23,480
Yeah.


65
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:25,320
It's like Come on folks, are we reading


66
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,860
the same weather reports.


67
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,059
It's tempting to think logic should prevail, right.


68
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:30,900
Of course.


69
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,559
Yeah.


70
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,459
But human behavior.


71
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,220
Yeah.


72
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,260
It's not always logical.


73
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,959
Right.


74
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,120
It's complex, right.


75
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,059
You can give someone all the facts and figures in the world


76
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:44,459
about rising sea levels and, you know, storms intensifying.


77
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,059
Yeah.


78
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,379
But there's an emotional element too to where we choose to live.


79
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,940
You know, a connection to place.


80
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,500
That's really hard to shake, even when


81
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,940
it seems like, you know.


82
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,379
It's risky to be there.


83
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,820
People are complicated.


84
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,940
It's true and that kind of leads us to well,


85
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,679
it's a pretty radical idea that you brought up in your research.


86
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,559
Yeah.


87
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,220
Could artificial intelligence,


88
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,320
maybe even like super intelligent AI,


89
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:20,339
be the answer to our, you know, our climate inaction problem?


90
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:21,559
That's a big question.


91
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,059
You even had a term for it. ASI authoritarian month.


92
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:26,220
Yeah. Yeah.


93
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,559
It's it's a bold idea to say the least.


94
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:29,960
It definitely makes you think right.


95
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,000
And I and I understand where it's coming from.


96
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,139
That feeling that we need to act fast.


97
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,000
Right. We need to act decisively.


98
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,259
Yeah.


99
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,300
And so ASI authoritarian month basically means


100
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,100
Okay,


101
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,199
we'd be letting a super intelligent AI


102
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,380
call the shots. Right.


103
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,779
For one month. Okay.


104
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,720
To kind of implement climate solutions


105
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,940
with a speed and efficiency.


106
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,259
Yeah. That we as humans, you know,


107
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,520
right. You can't match.


108
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,119
Right. So we're talking with an AI


109
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:57,860
so advanced it could analyze global systems,


110
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,660
design solutions, maybe even like overhaul


111
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,600
entire industries to make them,


112
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,500
sustainable. Right. Right.


113
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,300
All in a month. It's a tall order.


114
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,679
It's sounds like a sci fi movie honestly.


115
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,899
Sounds like a movie, yeah.


116
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:13,880
But but then there's the other side of the coin right.


117
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,600
Right. Got to talk about the authoritarian part.


118
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,639
There it is. Yeah.


119
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,339
What about the ethics?


120
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:20,179
Like are we really gonna just


121
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,279
hand over control like that?


122
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,820
That's the million dollar question,


123
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,080
isn't it? I mean, right.


124
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,259
Even if we just assume for a second.


125
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,119
Yeah. And it's a big if. Right.


126
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:32,259
Yeah. That an ASI


127
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:36,539
right would even act in humanities best interests.


128
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,279
Right. You know who defines that.


129
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,399
Exactly. Yeah.


130
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,940
Like what does that even mean? How do we ensure,


131
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,800
you know, things that we really care about?


132
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,100
Yah.


133
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,179
Individual liberty, democratic principles.


134
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,419
Right.


135
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,240
you know, trampled on ...


136
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,559
Yeah. ... in the process.


137
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,960
It seems risky.


138
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,419
And the biggest unknown of all. Right.


139
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,820
Right.


140
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,100
What are the unintended consequences of giving?


141
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,279
Like, you know ...


142
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,600
That much power. Unlimited power.


143
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,880
Yah.


144
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,740
You know, to something we might not even comprehend.


145
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,740
And that's what I found so interesting about your point.


146
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,960
Okay.


147
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,940
Connecting this back to what AI can already do.


148
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,240
Yeah.


149
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,200
Like you mentioned research showing that AI


150
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,739
can now get this ...


151
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,119
Okay. ... decode what someone is seeing


152
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,480
just by analyzing their brain activity.


153
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,700
I know. It's wild.


154
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,440
It's like they use fMRI scans.


155
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,679
Yeah.


156
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:31,940
Feed that data into these like sophisticated neural networks


157
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,980
trained on these massive data sets of,


158
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,239
you know, ... Yeah.


159
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,619
... brain activity and corresponding images.


160
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:38,980
It's kind of incredible.


161
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,760
It really is. It's like something out of science fiction,


162
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,980
but it's real.


163
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,239
It's becoming real. Yeah.


164
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,559
It's happening now.


165
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,899
If AI can already do that, tap into our brains like that ...


166
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,579
Yeah. ... how can we control something


167
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:55,320
potentially thousands of times more intelligent?


168
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,920
It's a crucial point, and you know it circles


169
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,320
back to the part of like your concerns about the limitations.




PART 2 
1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
We now bring to you some of the facilitations


2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,780
of our current approaches.


3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,620
Like education.


4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,780
Right. We talk about these things.


5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,680
Certiainly.


6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,140
Ignition reform, improving communication.


7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,020
Right.


8
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,180
But the gap between AI's capabilities


9
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,400
and our understanding-


10
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,360
It's huge.


11
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,660
... is widening at an alarming pace.


12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,120
It's only getting bigger.


13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,100
How do we bridge that?


14
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,000
How do we even ensure that we're the ones in control?


15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,540
We're steering the future


16
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,959
and not just passengers along for the ride.


17
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,500
So we talked about AI, right?


18
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,299
The potential, the risks, but your research,


19
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:37,980
it took this whole other turn.


20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,279
Yeah.


21
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,119
Something that really honestly kind of baffled me,


22
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:45,480
but also, I got to say, intrigued me.


23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,480
Interesting.


24
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,680
You started exploring


25
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,320
get this transhumanism as a potential solution.


26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,560
Right.


27
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:53,860
I mean it sounds like are we even-


28
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,400
It's out there.


29
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:56,419
A whole other dimension.


30
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:57,660
It's under the boundaries, that's for sure.


31
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,959
Right.


32
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,320
We really follow the thread of your research.


33
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,739
That may be the biggest hurdle to all this,


34
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,440
to tackling climate change.


35
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,559
That might be us.


36
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,239
Our own limitations as humans.


37
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,339
Right.


38
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,440
Transhumanism, it-


39
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,540
It's a thought.


40
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,279
It starts to seem a little more possible.


41
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,540
Right.


42
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,639
Maybe not less radical,


43
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,580
but definitely a possible path forward.


44
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,959
Okay, so for those of us who haven't spent our time


45
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,820
in the transhumanism corner of the internet.


46
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,459
Right, right.


47
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,019
Let's unpack that a little bit.


48
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,419
I think when people hear transhumanism,


49
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:38,919
they probably picture dystopian futures.


50
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,120
Right, right.


51
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,980
Cyborgs and like-


52
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,419
You know-


53
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,699
Immortality Serums.


54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,300
Yeah. Immortality Serums, exactly, that kind of thing.


55
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,400
It's easy to get caught up


56
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:49,639
in the sensationalized versions of it.


57
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,860
Right.


58
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,239
But, at its heart, transhumanism,


59
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,940
it's really about-


60
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,099
Yeah.


61
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:56,800
Using technology to enhance human capabilities.


62
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,139
Okay.


63
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,400
And in this case, we're not talking about-


64
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,639
Right.


65
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,900
You know, superhuman strength or telekinesis or anything.


66
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
Right.


67
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,360
We're talking about like enhancing our capacity


68
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,839
for thinking long term.


69
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,039
Okay.


70
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,500
For making good decisions based on complex information.


71
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,740
Yeah.


72
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:16,039
For understanding how all these global systems are connected.


73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,839
So like overcoming our limitations.


74
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,919
Yes, exactly.


75
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,240
The cognitive biases.


76
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:22,720
Those cognitive biases that lead to these like-


77
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,820
Our short sighted choices.


78
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,919
Exactly. Yeah.


79
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,119
The short sighted choices.


80
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,979
If we could enhance those parts of ourselves.


81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,100
Right.


82
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,080
Maybe even bridge that gap you were talking about before.


83
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,380
Yeah, yeah.


84
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,619
Between, you know, our brains and these rapidly evolving


85
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,779
AI brains, would that make us better equipped


86
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,720
to actually handle something as complex as climate change?


87
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,979
That's the question, right?


88
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,160
That's a big one.


89
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,460
It's a huge question.


90
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,520
And of course, it opens up like a whole Pandora's box


91
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,619
of considerations.


92
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,000
Right.


93
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,639
But I think the fact that we're even having this conversation,


94
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:00,220
that your research led us to this point,


95
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,619
it just speaks to the urgency of this whole climate crisis.


96
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
When.


97
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,619
We need to be open to considering


98
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,919
all these possibilities, even the ones that…


99
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,100
The ones that blow our minds a little bit.


100
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,600
Exactly, you know?


101
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,139
The ones that really challenge our understanding


102
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,000
of what it means to even be human.


103
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,059
And you know, it's funny because when


104
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,539
I saw that you had been looking into


105
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,539
like computers made of mushrooms.


106
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,539
Oh, right.


107
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,339
Biocomputing? Is that what they call it?


108
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,940
Yeah, biocomputing. That's right.


109
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,440
I gotta say, I laughed.


110
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,479
Right.


111
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,000
Because if you'd told me a year ago


112
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,020
that that's where this deep dive into climate change


113
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,279
was going to take us


114
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,339
I don't think I would have believed you.


115
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,559
But… but here we are, talking about,


116
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,580
you know, merging with machines.


117
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:46,820
It just goes to show you, right,


118
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,919
like, we are living in an era of this


119
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:52,279
wild technological advancement.


120
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,479
It's happening so fast.


121
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,660
And with that comes this responsibility,


122
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,600
I think


123
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,619
yeah.


124
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,020
to really ask the tough questions.


125
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,059
Yeah.


126
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,100
Right.


127
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,139
To consider all the pass, all the options.


128
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Yeah. Right.


129
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,460
As wild as some of them may seem.


130
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,039
So where do we go from here?


131
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:07,339
That's the question.


132
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,800
I mean, I think this deep dive


133
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,240
has really like brought it home.


134
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,279
Yeah.


135
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,080
That there are no easy answers here.


136
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,339
No easy answers.


137
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,820
But you've brought up some ideas


138
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,339
that really make you think


139
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,559
and maybe that's the point.


140
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,739
And maybe that's the most important take away


141
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,339
for people listening.


142
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,700
Yeah.


143
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:26,299
You know from your research, from your questions.


144
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,440
Yeah.


145
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,440
It just highlights how much we need to be


146
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,579
like bolder in our thinking.


147
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:32,820
Be more creative.


148
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,279
More creative, more willing to challenge


149
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,820
our own assumptions.


150
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,820
About what's possible.


151
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,420
What's about possible. Exactly.


152
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:39,980
Because the future is unwritten.


153
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,420
The future is unwritten. Yeah.


154
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,519
And it's up to us.


155
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,660
It's up to us to decide.


156
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,720
What role we want technology


157
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,359
and even our own evolution


158
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,579
to play?


159
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:50,779
What role we want to play in shaping it all.


160
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,880
Exactly.


161
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,019
And maybe, just maybe,


162
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,720
like it's not about finding the perfect solution.


163
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,100
It's about asking the right questions.


164
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,299
Asking the right questions.


165
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,339
Like you've done here.


166
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,839
There you go.


167
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:05,339
If A.I can already basically read our minds


168
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,940
in these like crazy sophisticated ways


169
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes pretty much.


170
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,399
what does that even mean for us?


171
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,399
For humans?


172
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,279
Right.


173
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,779
You know, for our agency,


174
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,019
our decision making?


175
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,940
Yeah.


176
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,320
Whether we're talking A.I governance


177
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,739
or transhumanism


178
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,279
or something we haven't


179
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,079
even thought of yet.


180
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,079
Exactly.


181
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,920
Who knows what the future holds.


182
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,820
But it's something to ponder.


183
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,579
Something to think about.


184
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,820
Until next time, everyone,


185
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:31,760
keep asking those big questions.
