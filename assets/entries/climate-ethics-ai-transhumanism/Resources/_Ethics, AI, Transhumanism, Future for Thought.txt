No Ethical Solution for Stopping Climate Disasters

This was a logic path that Perplexity and I worked our way through, I proposed ideas, it would bring up the implications and why it wouldn't work. Then it would propose what would work, and I'd remind it why that likely wouldn't work with the timeline. 

Afterwards, we unexpectedly, ended up with "Transhumanism" as the most ethical and most likely scenario of both preventing disasters and a future living with super-intelligent being in general. 

We have a lot of documents for this. I dug hard to find the original conversation and finally did.

We broke it down. I was pulling out unnecessary parts of the conversation and trying to craft better data for the NotebookLM podcast tool to create a better podcast. 
Part 1
/Users/seanivore/Projects/portfolio-draft/entries-drafting/Entries/23 - No Ethical Solution for Stopping Climate Disasters/2 - PART 1 Avoiding Climate Disasters Have Ethical Problems At Every Turn.txt

Part 2 
/Users/seanivore/Projects/portfolio-draft/entries-drafting/Entries/23 - No Ethical Solution for Stopping Climate Disasters/2 - PART 2 Following The Logic, Avoiding Ethical Issues Has A Mind-Bending Solution.txt

Then there are a bunch of back-up documents looking at the same subject through other lenses. *Perhaps this entry as a whole is an innovative way to look at truly novel situations that are, now more than ever, important things we need people to be thinking and talking about, but people are just so hesitant*

Then before being forced to move on to other projects, you and I had started to create our own script for a better podcast.
