Below is the drafted post for these NFTs. They're visually impressive, particularly being hand drawn and vector and then step-motion animated. I also felt they were important to add NFT type stuff because that is what got me into my previous web3 job. Perhaps there is more to say and I'm blanking? 
The gifs, if you want to see them via path, are here: /Users/seanivore/Projects/portfolio-clean/assets/entries/cartoon-gif-meme-nfts

Anamorphic GIFs of Classic Cartoon Characters & Memes Minted as NFTs

While producing social media content for a web3 DAO I spent some of the time creating modern, clean, mesmerizing versions of classic memes. Sometimes altering them for the brand to use as well. These were minted as NFTs on various NFT store sites.
