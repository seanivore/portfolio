# Rapid MCP Tool Integration: Building Advanced Code Analysis in Hours

## Overview
Rapidly implemented a suite of integrated tools using Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), focusing on advanced code analysis capabilities. The project demonstrates the ability to quickly adopt and implement new technologies while delivering practical, production-ready solutions.

## Technical Implementation

In an intensive development sprint, I created a sophisticated code analysis tool using Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) in under 6 hours. The project showcases rapid prototyping capabilities while maintaining production-quality standards. The tool has since been recognized by the MCP community and included in mcpai.app's official collection of MCP tools.

### Core Architecture
The system was built around three main components. 

1. **Analysis Engine**
	- Deep code parsing and understanding
	- Structure analysis (functions, classes, methods)
	- Complexity analysis (cyclomatic complexity, decision points)
	- Dependency tracking

2. **Integration Layer
	- MCP protocol implementation
	- Supporting Tools
	- Web Search Integration
	- GitHub Repository Access
	- File System Operations
	- Memory Management


3. **Tool Manager**
   ```typescript
   class MCPToolManager {
     private tools: Map<string, Tool>;

     registerTool(tool: Tool): void {
       this.validateTool(tool);
       this.tools.set(tool.name, tool);
     }

     async executeTool(name: string, params: any): Promise<any> {
       const tool = this.tools.get(name);
       if (!tool) throw new Error(`Tool ${name} not found`);
       return await tool.handler(params);
     }
   }
   ```

### Key Features

1. **Code Structure Analysis**
   - Function and class detection
   - Method analysis
   - Scope understanding

2. **Complexity Assessment**
   - Cyclomatic complexity calculation
   - Decision point analysis
   - Code metrics generation

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Import tracking
   - Module dependency analysis
   - Library usage assessment

      analysis_type: {
        type: "string",
        enum: ["structure", "quality", "security"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
