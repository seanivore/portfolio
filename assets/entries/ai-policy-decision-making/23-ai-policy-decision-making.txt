Climate change. Global economic systems. Human cognitive enhancement. These are what philosopher Timothy Morton calls "hyperobjects" — phenomena so vast and complex that they exceed our ability to fully comprehend them. As we face increasing pressure to make policy decisions about these hyperobjects, artificial intelligence emerges as both a powerful tool and a source of new complexity in the policy-making landscape.

Consider climate change: a phenomenon that operates across centuries, affects every corner of our planet, and interacts with countless variables in ways that challenge human cognition. Traditional policy-making approaches, constrained by human cognitive limitations and political timeframes, have struggled to address its scale and complexity. This is where AI enters the conversation, not as a silver bullet, but as a tool that might help us grasp the previously ungraspable.

The Aurora model, for instance, represents a breakthrough in climate prediction by leveraging neural networks to process and analyze climate data at unprecedented scales. Unlike traditional climate models, Aurora can integrate diverse data sources — from satellite imagery to ocean temperature readings — and identify subtle patterns that might escape human notice. This capability exemplifies both the promise and complexity of AI in policy decisions: while it offers insights beyond human capacity, it also raises questions about how we verify and trust its conclusions.

CAPTION: Without AI how might we actually make breakthrough climate predictions? 

The integration of AI into policy-making extends beyond data analysis. In areas like human enhancement technologies, AI systems could help model the societal implications of various policy choices. They could simulate the effects of different regulatory frameworks, predict unintended consequences, and identify potential equity issues before they emerge. The speed and comprehensiveness of these analyses could dramatically improve the policy-making process.

CAPTION: AI in policy = unintended consequences? Or dramatic improvement in process? 

However, this potential comes with significant caveats. The same complexity that makes AI valuable in policy-making also makes it challenging to oversee. When an AI system recommends a particular climate policy, how do we audit its reasoning? How do we ensure its recommendations haven't inherited biases from its training data? These questions become even more pressing when considering policies about AI itself — a recursive challenge that highlights the need for careful human oversight.

The automation of certain policy-making functions raises additional concerns about job displacement in government sectors. While AI might excel at data analysis and modeling, the human elements of policy-making — building consensus, understanding local contexts, and making ethical judgments — remain crucial. The challenge lies in finding the right balance: using AI to enhance human decision-making without diminishing the role of human judgment and democratic processes.

The stakes are particularly high when considering human enhancement technologies. AI could help model the implications of various enhancement technologies and their regulation, but it also raises profound questions about equity and access. Who gets enhanced? Who decides? How do we ensure AI-driven policy decisions in this arena don't exacerbate existing social inequalities?

Privacy concerns add another layer of complexity. As AI systems become more sophisticated in their ability to analyze human behavior and even neural activity, how do we craft policies that protect individual privacy while harnessing these capabilities for public good? The recent developments in brain-computer interfaces make these questions increasingly urgent.

A path forward emerges when we consider AI as a tool for expanding human capability rather than replacing human judgment. In addressing hyperobjects like climate change, AI can help us understand complex systems and identify potential solutions. However, the final decisions must remain in human hands, guided by ethical principles and democratic values.

The integration of AI into policy decisions represents a critical juncture in governance. Success will require not just technological advancement, but also robust ethical frameworks and ongoing public dialogue. As younger generations assume positions of power, bringing with them greater technological literacy and different perspectives on AI, the nature of policy-making will likely transform. The goal should be to harness AI's capabilities while ensuring that technology serves human values and enhances, rather than diminishes, human agency in shaping our collective future.

This balance — between technological capability and human wisdom, between efficiency and transparency, between progress and equity — will define the success or failure of AI integration in policy-making. As we face increasingly complex global challenges, getting this balance right becomes not just important, but essential for our future.
