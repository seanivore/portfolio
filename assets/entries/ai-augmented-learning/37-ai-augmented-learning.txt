	- We were tired of the rate limits using Anthropics web app
	- Created messenger UI
	- Refined it, then added file upload to conversation for images, PDF, etc. 
	- Then added RAG aspects with chunking, embedding, etc. 
	- Look to actual Development folder for more info. 
	- Then rewrite accordingly 
	- Is the slug appropriate
