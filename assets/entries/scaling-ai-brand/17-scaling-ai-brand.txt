Evolution of Astrofluenced Brand in Phases

First, find each phase defined. 
Second, find visuals that can be integrated into post. 

Below that are two different entry drafts that seem super similar. 

Idea here being to turn this into an even more comprehensive case study using Astrofluenced as an example specifically. 

I have another entry that is more generally about creating "agentic-automated-marketing-department" where I have examples that below doesn't cover as well as some overlapping examples — which I think is okay for telling the story two different ways (?). 

Also a chart...

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanivore/portfolio/refs/heads/portfolio-seanivore/assets/entries/scaling-ai-brand/img-chart-1-scaling-automated-content.webp

=====
>>PHASE 1 
- Automated Generative Written Blogs
- Automated Their Promotions with Generative Produced Social Posts 

1. Human — Simply put the location of the planets in one database each week.

2. Generative AI — Massive automations that used AI's natural ability to craft content about archetypes of astrology. We used this to our advantage to create not just pseudo-helpful content of interest like horoscopes, but took it a step further to create content that broke down how to improve ones life through personal growth. In creating the generative automated copy produced and published for these blogs and social posts, we pushed the automations further always being sure to create more content than needed which we later capitalized on.

3. Both - Created artistically relevant images that fit the brand, about 200 each week to start, keeping organized in dropbox archive, always creating more for presumptive future use in new types of media and mediums. 


This is a PHASE ONE type post on Astrofluenced
It should be primarily about the process used for making an automated brand in general 
- 1st planning out brand
- 2nd making content 
- 3rd researching newest ways to automate production 
- 4th dissemination of new tools versus old process 
- 5th laying out full automation plan by media and medium type
- 6th implementation of each 'leg' of brand
- 7th running, optimization, QA 
- 8th profit* 


=====
>>PHASE 2 
- Maintaining Phase 1 Media Production, Presentation 
- Integration of API Video Short Production

1. Human 
	- Previous operations optimized to couple hours a week. 
	- Build one 60 second video Shotstack template. 
	- Review, adjust (QA) surplus copy produced in Phase 1 automations 

2. Automation — Pulling from databases and applying template, rendering new videos, saving them to database that publishing automation pulls from. 

3. Generative AI - reviewed media and copy used in video short production and writes multiple captions for posting to multiple social media channels. Content is added to same publishing database. 

=====
>>PHASE 3  
- Continued Phase 1 Production, Presentation Maintenance 
- Addition of Video Production Automation Maintenance 
- Creation of Astrofluenced Podcast Creating Biggest Impact 

1. Human - All previous operations continued, now ~1 days work. 

2. Agentic, Generative, Automated AI - 
	- Previously written blog copy in database used in a new way. 
	- Scenarios more complex involving reviews and decision making. 
	- Create long before I knew what a 'RAG' was, before term was colloquial. 
	- Huge database of text and images strategically informed prepared prompts. 
	- Prompts resulted in entirely new content — this time actual VO to be spoken. 
	- Used GPT model for initial writing and structure of script. 
	- Used Claude model for editing adding voice. 
	- AI reviewed each other's work. 
	- Automation then pushed to TTS production 

3. Human - Most work of all prior phases. Clips produced edited together in Audition with audio. Visual FX created for Youtube Podcast made in After Effects. Transcript turned into captioning in Premier Pro.

---ALL PHASES---

ADMIN FOR ALL CONTENT TYPE

Automation for creation of tracked URLs triggered after Webflow publication every week, adding the fully tracked URLs to the same database that will later be pulled when the automated flow for posting content runs.

---ALL PHASES---

EMAILING AI CONTENT FOR CREATING EMBEDDINGS 

This was primary for sending an Assistant content as it was created so that it could create embeddings and have knowledge of all produced content through all phases as well as performance and brand art. This later allowed the assistant to plan content without creating redundant content, being able to see what worked best, asses why, to replicate copy and voice style, etc.

---ALL PHASES---

CREATING WRITTEN CONTENT

Mass of content produced generatively with minimal to no human interaction once prompts were perfected over time.

---PHASE THREE---

ASTROFLUENCED PODCAST PRODUCTION 

1. The blogs on the website were all automated, producing over 100 a week
2. We had hundreds of brand art images created each week as well 
3. Those were published as web content, promoted automatically
