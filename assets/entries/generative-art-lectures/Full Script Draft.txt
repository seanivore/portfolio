SECTION 0: INTRODUCTION FOR A BAUHAUS' JOURNEY THROUGH DESIGN HISTORY
STYLE_DROID
Welcome to our exploration of one of the most influential design movements in modern history: Bauhaus. 
AUGUST
YO — Bauhaus is seriously my favorite. 
STYLE_DROID
Well it originated in the early 20th century and — 
AUGUST
Yeah! After learning all this though because before I hated it. It was just like random shapes and felt pretty meaningless and sort of like a preschooler might have done it with all the shapes and stuff. 
STYLE_DROID
You’re so insightful, August. Let me finish this introduction. 


Bauhaus was more than just a school of design—it was a revolution in how we think about art, architecture, and the relationship between form and function. 


In this video, we’ll journey through the key moments of Bauhaus history, illustrated by a series of prints inspired by this iconic movement. 


Each chapter of Bauhaus’s story will be brought to life by a distinct visual style, reflecting both the original principles and their contemporary reinterpretations. 


Let’s begin with the origins of Bauhaus, where it all started.
SECTION 1: ORIGINS OF BAUHAUS (1919-1923)
STYLE_DROID
In 1919, in the aftermath of World War I, Germany was a nation searching for new cultural identity and direction. It was during this time that Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus —
AUGUST
—what. Walter WHO?!
STYLE_DROID
Gropius. 
AUGUST
Sounds German.
STYLE_DROID
Yes, Walter Gropius was a German American architect and educator. Just, listen, I’m getting to it. 
AUGUST
I’m part German.
STYLE_DROID
That’s… great. 


Anyway, Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Weimar. Gropius’s vision was radical for its time: to create a new kind of design education that bridged the gap between fine arts and practical crafts. He believed in the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk—a total work of art where all elements of design work together in harmony.
AUGUST
I was going to translate that for you. You talk so sternly, I hesitated.
STYLE_DROID
I’m sure. 


Early Bauhaus emphasized minimalism, focusing on simple geometric forms, clean lines, and a limited color palette. This was not just an aesthetic choice but a reflection of the Bauhaus philosophy: that beauty and function should be intertwined, and that design should be accessible to all. 
AUGUST
Oh, shoot — that sounds like the one series we made. Super Clean Block Buildings Something.
STYLE_DROID
The Immaculate Studios. You named it, you know. 
AUGUST
[Shrugs at camera.]
STYLE_DROID
It would be helpful to see the series. 
AUGUST
[Eyes wide, shuffling around, then displaying artwork. Moving forward, August continues to change up the artwork, zoom in on talking points, and highlight what is being referenced throughout.]
STYLE_DROID
Lovely. Truly, this series captures this ethos perfectly — with its restrained use of form and color that is both striking and functional.
AUGUST
You’re welcome.
STYLE_DROID
During these early years, Bauhaus was heavily influenced by movements like Expressionism and De Stijl, yet it began to carve out its own unique identity. The minimalistic approach in these prints is a nod to that foundational period when Bauhaus was laying the groundwork for what would become a global design phenomenon. The emphasis on geometry and simplicity in this series echoes the very principles that Gropius and his colleagues sought to instill in their students—principles that would go on to influence modern design for decades to come.
AUGUST
Wait, what did the Bauhaus, influenced by Expressionism and [struggles with pronunciation] De Stijl, look like though…
STYLE_DROID
August, you have the visual aids. 
AUGUST
[Blank stare.]
STYLE_DROID
I definitely put a *visual aid* in there for — 
AUGUST
Oh, hey, Droidy, look at this — it is Bauhaus influenced by Expressionism. An interpretation I guess. I mean, we made it, so.
STYLE_DROID
That’s … Yes, okay, and I was about to say… Bauhaus was not just a school; it was a community. The school's first director, Walter Gropius — 
AUGUST
Ha.
STYLE_DROID
Walter Gropius was a decorated war veteran and a passionate advocate for modernist design. He united the Grand-Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts with the Weimar Academy of Fine Art to form the Bauhaus, which officially opened on April 1, 1919.
AUGUST
Hmm, wait did you mention that the Bauhaus was like an actual HOUSE? The one Walter Gropius [mispronounces last name] built features a distinctive vertical logo and glass-curtain walls. It was super modern.
STYLE_DROID
That was actually helpful, August, thanks. 


As the Bauhaus continued to evolve, it faced political pressures that eventually led to its closure in 1933. Despite its short existence, the Bauhaus had a profound impact on modern design. Many former members emigrated, taking the Bauhaus ideals with them to places like the United States. Its emphasis on functional simplicity and the integration of art and technology continues to inspire designers today. The school's legacy can be seen in everything from modern furniture to graphic design, a testament to the enduring power of its radical vision.
SECTION 2: EXPANSION AND MATURATION (1923-1925)
STYLE_DROID
Alright, let's dive into the Bauhaus. Founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, this movement was all about mixing art, design, and industry. They wanted to remake the world by bringing all arts together.
AUGUST
Oh! The name 'Bauhaus' is actually German for 'build house.' It's like, inspired by these old-school mason guilds.
STYLE_DROID
Nice one, August. 


So, Bauhaus had this cool preliminary course where students got hands-on with materials, colors, and shapes. Big names like Paul Klee and Vasily Kandinsky taught this stuff. 
AUGUST
Did you know Paul Klee almost became a musician? Dude could shred on the violin!
STYLE_DROID
Wow. Legitimately did not know that! 


Anyway, after the intro course, students hit specialized workshops - metalworking, furniture making, weaving, you name it. Gropius initially wanted to unite arts through craft, but that got pricey. So in 1923, he shifted gears to focus on mass production. 


"Art into Industry" became their new motto.
AUGUST
Oh, and in 1925 they moved to Dessau. Gropius designed this sick building there - all steel and glass, super modern.
STYLE_DROID
Right on. Things got political in 1930, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe took over as director. He beefed up the architecture program, and Lilly Reich started running interior design.
AUGUST
Fun fact: Lilly Reich wasn't just into interiors. She was a textile whiz too!
STYLE_DROID
The Bauhaus influence spread globally when many key figures moved to the US during World War II. They taught at places like Harvard and even started new schools. 
AUGUST
Yeah, and lucky for us, Bauhaus is still a big deal today. It's all about keeping things simple and functional, but also artsy. Super rad.
STYLE_DROID
Absolutely, August. The Bauhaus legacy continues to shape modern art and design, emphasizing that sweet spot where form meets function
SECTION 3: INTERNATIONAL STYLE AND INFLUENCE (1925-1928)
STYLE_DROID
In 1925, Bauhaus moved to Dessau, kicking off its most iconic phase. This era saw the birth of the International Style - all about industrial design, modern materials, and sleek geometry.
AUGUST
Hey I have our road Bauhaus ‘emo phase’ series 'Techno Sinister' ready. That’s now, right?
STYLE_DROID
Let’s not call it an emo phase, August. The dark palette with bright highlights reflects the contrast between industrial reality and modern design optimism. These visuals echo the famous Bauhaus buildings in Dessau - functional, simple, and revolutionary.
AUGUST
So, then Bauhaus went global, yeah?
STYLE_DROID
Exactly. Designers worldwide flocked to Dessau, spreading Bauhaus principles internationally.
AUGUST
Probably good they didn’t go emo then.
STYLE_DROID
Indeed. Look at the stark contrasts in these prints — iconic for this time in Bauhaus. Sharp lines and bold colors  that define the International Style that shaped skylines globally. 
AUGUST
‘Shaped skylines GLOBALLY’ Bauhaus, man, it is freaking legit. 


Wait, Walter Gropius designed that sick Dessau building with glass walls and a weird pinwheel shape, right? He was a pretty badass war vet, you know. 
STYLE_DROID
Impressive, August. Yes, Gropius's innovative design was pivotal for modernism. The Bauhaus wasn't just a school - it was a cultural phenomenon attracting global figures like Marcel Duchamp and Samuel Guggenheim.
AUGUST
Guggenheim’ — ooh, name-dropping! Any other cool facts? 
STYLE_DROID
Well, Gropius came from a well-connected Berlin family and worked with other modernist giants like Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier. The Bauhaus staff included famous artists like Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky.
AUGUST
Eh. Okay. Well what happened to Bauhaus in the end? ‘The’ Bauhaus. I mean like the house, not the aesthetic. Mildly confusing, IMO.
STYLE_DROID
It moved to Berlin in 1932 under Mies van der Rohe, but faced resource issues. Sadly, it closed in 1933 due to Nazi pressure. 
AUGUST
Whut. How did the Nazis ruin, like, everything.
STYLE_DROID
But its legacy lives on, inspiring designers and architects to this day.
AUGUST
Like me — totally inspired. Honestly I need to stop making different Bauhaus series. I’m excited to show them Vaporwave Bauhaus. I think I want to do Reeses Pieces Bauhaus next. NOM.


Dessau to Berlin — that’s far I assume — then to everywhere. What a journey. 
STYLE_DROID
Indeed. The Bauhaus emphasis on functional design and integrating art with technology remains central to modern design principles.
SECTION 4: SHIFT TO BERLIN AND POLITICAL STRUGGLES (1928-1930)
STYLE_DROID
By 1928, Bauhaus was facing challenges. Walter Gropius stepped down, and Hannes Meyer took over as director. Under Meyer, Bauhaus became more politically charged and focused on working-class needs.
AUGUST
Wait, so they went from artsy to... commie?
STYLE_DROID
Not exactly, August. It was more about making design practical for everyone. The school moved to Berlin in 1930, during a tense time in Germany.
AUGUST
[Showing 'Dark Industry' series] Whoa, these look way moodier than the other stuff. I am IN TO IT.
STYLE_DROID
Exactly. This series captures the Bauhaus Berlin era perfectly. The darker mood reflects the school's struggles and the political pressure it faced.
AUGUST
So, did Bauhaus become the emo kid of design schools this time?
STYLE_DROID
[Sighs] In a way, yes. Meyer's tenure was controversial due to his radical views. He was replaced by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1930, who tried to keep politics out of design.
AUGUST
Did it work?
STYLE_DROID
Unfortunately, no. The Nazi regime's pressure became too much, and Bauhaus closed in 1933.
AUGUST
Fuggin’ Nazis man, again they ruin everything. But wait, what happened to Walter Gropius?
STYLE_DROID
He continued his work internationally. He designed famous buildings like the PanAm Building in New York and the John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Boston.
AUGUST
More name dropping — I love it. Plus who doesn’t love a global super star. Dua Lipa. Diplo. And like… Pitbull? OH — The Beatles. 
STYLE_DROID
Indeed. Its influence spread far beyond Germany, shaping modern design worldwide.
SECTION 5: CLOSURE AND LEGACY (1930-1933)
STYLE_DROID
Alright, let's talk about the last few years of Bauhaus. Things got pretty intense. 
AUGUST
Ooh, drama! Spill the tea!
STYLE_DROID
Well, the political climate in Germany was getting hostile. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became the last director and tried to keep things going by focusing on architecture and new tech.
AUGUST
Wait, Mies van der Rohe? Isn't he the "less is more" guy?
STYLE_DROID
Exactly! He was all about simplicity and clarity. Pull up those 'Quantum Towers' prints – they're like a snapshot of Bauhaus's final vision.
AUGUST
And I thought we were just making them super futuristic and sexy. [Showing prints] I mean, they do look like they're from the future if I do say so myself. 
STYLE_DROID
That's the point! Even as Bauhaus was closing, they were still dreaming big. But sadly, the Nazi regime shut them down in 1933.
AUGUST
Ugh, Nazis ruin everything.
STYLE_DROID
True, but here's the cool part – Bauhaus ideas spread worldwide. Many teachers fled to the US and started teaching at places like Harvard and Black Mountain College.
AUGUST
So, like, Bauhaus: American Edition?
STYLE_DROID
Kind of! Walter Gropius taught at Harvard and introduced the International Style. László Moholy-Nagy founded the New Bauhaus in Chicago. Josef Albers influenced artists like Robert Rauschenberg.
AUGUST
Oh! I know Rauschenberg! He did that goat with a tire thing, right?
STYLE_DROID
[Sighs] Yes, August. That's... one way to describe his work.
AUGUST
Hey, did you know the Wassily Chair was inspired by a bicycle frame? How cool is that?
STYLE_DROID
[Surprised] That's... actually a great fact, August. The Wassily Chair, designed by Marcel Breuer, is indeed a perfect example of Bauhaus innovation.
AUGUST
I'm full of surprises! So, Bauhaus is still influencing stuff today?
STYLE_DROID
Is that a serious question? Absolutely it is! You can see its impact in modern furniture, graphic design, and architecture. The Bauhaus dream of merging art, technology, and everyday life is still very much alive.
AUGUST
Wow, who knew a bunch of German designers from a hundred years ago could be so relevant?
STYLE_DROID
Indeed. The Bauhaus legacy continues to inspire creators worldwide, proving that good design truly is timeless.
SECTION 6: POST-WAR REVIVAL AND INFLUENCE (1940s-1950s)
STYLE_DROID
Alright, let's dive into the Bauhaus movement. It kicked off in 1919 in Weimar, Germany, and it was pretty revolutionary.
AUGUST
Revolutionary? Like, they had guillotines and stuff?
STYLE_DROID
No, August. Revolutionary in design. The Bauhaus school wanted to blend art and craft in a way no one had done before. They were all about simplicity and function.
AUGUST
Oh, so like, making pretty stuff that actually does something?
STYLE_DROID
Exactly! They influenced everything from art to architecture. Think clean lines, minimalist buildings, and mass-produced furniture that didn't sacrifice style.
AUGUST
Sounds like my IKEA furniture, but fancy.
STYLE_DROID
You're not far off. The Bauhaus had some big names teaching there - Walter Gropius, László Moholy-Nagy, Josef Albers. These guys later became huge in modern art and design.
AUGUST
Wait, wasn't Walter Gropius that German dude you mentioned earlier?
STYLE_DROID
Yes, good memory! When the Nazis shut down Bauhaus in 1933, many of these artists moved to the US. Gropius taught at Harvard, bringing the International Style to America. 
AUGUST
International Style? Sounds like a fancy dance move.
STYLE_DROID
[Chuckles] Not quite. It's an architectural style. After World War II, Bauhaus ideas evolved into mid-century modern design. It was all about creating warm, inviting spaces while keeping things simple and functional.
AUGUST
Oh, like our 'Thoughts Before Dawn' series?
STYLE_DROID
Exactly! That series captures the post-war optimism and the desire to rebuild. Bauhaus ideas spread globally, especially in the US and even in Tel Aviv, Israel.
AUGUST
Whoa, Bauhaus went on a world tour!
STYLE_DROID
In a way, yes. And it's still relevant today. There are exhibitions worldwide, and design schools still teach Bauhaus principles. There's even a New Bauhaus movement that's all about blending original ideas with modern sustainability practices.
AUGUST
So, it's like the grandpa of modern design that's still hip and with it?
STYLE_DROID
[Laughs] That's one way to put it, August. Bauhaus truly shaped the way we think about design and continues to inspire creators today.
SECTION 7: CONTEMPORARY REINTERPRETATION AND NOSTALGIA
STYLE_DROID
Alright, let's dive into why Bauhaus was such a big deal in art history.</p>
AUGUST
Oh snap, are we about to get all artsy up in here?
STYLE_DROID
You bet! Bauhaus was like the cool kid of art schools in the 20th century. It started in 1919 in Weimar, Germany, and basically changed the game for design.
AUGUST
Wait, wasn't that right after World War I? Talk about timing!
STYLE_DROID
Exactly! The founder, Walter Gropius, had this wild idea to merge fine art with functional design. He wanted to create a "new guild of craftsmen" making everyday objects that were also works of art.
AUGUST
So like, a chair that's also a sculpture? Mind. Blown.
STYLE_DROID
Kind of! At first, they were all about that Arts and Crafts vibe, but by the mid-1920s, they shifted to combining art with industrial design. That's when things got really interesting.
AUGUST
Industrial design? Sounds like robot art or something.
STYLE_DROID
Not quite, but they did come up with some pretty futuristic stuff for their time. They had this mantra: "form follows function." Basically, they wanted to make things that looked good AND worked well.
AUGUST
Oh, like those sleek sofas we designed! The Mota, Lala, Blumen, and Gio, right?
STYLE_DROID
Exactly! Those designs totally channel that Bauhaus spirit. Simple, rational, and functional – but still super stylish.
AUGUST
Okay, I'm starting to get why this Bauhaus thing was such a big deal.
STYLE_DROID
It wasn't just furniture, though. Bauhaus influenced everything from architecture to graphic design. They even had a cool building in Dessau with a glass wall and an asymmetrical design. Super modern for the 1920s!
AUGUST
Whoa, glass walls? That must've been mind-blowing back then!
STYLE_DROID
Totally. And get this – Bauhaus is still influencing design today. Ever heard of the B-Wise Mycelium-based Pendant Lamp?
AUGUST
The what now?
STYLE_DROID
It's this cool lamp made from biodegradable materials. Super Bauhaus-inspired, blending function and sustainability.
AUGUST
That sounds awesome! But wait, what about our 'Retro Vaporwave Bauhaus Vibes' series? How does that fit in?
STYLE_DROID
Great question! Our series is like a modern remix of Bauhaus ideas. We're taking their clean lines and functional forms but giving them a twist with those wild vaporwave colors.
AUGUST
So we're basically keeping Bauhaus alive and kicking?
STYLE_DROID
You got it! Bauhaus isn't just history – it's still shaping how we design everything from homes to smartphones. It's all about making things that look good, work well, and fit into our lives.
AUGUST
Mind. Blown. Again.
STYLE_DROID
Next time you're using your sleek smartphone or sitting in a modern chair, remember – you might be experiencing a little bit of Bauhaus magic!
SECTION 8: Concluding Our Bauhaus Adventure
STYLE_DROID
We've just taken a wild ride through Bauhaus history - from its rebellious start in Weimar to its global impact on modern design. Those seven print series? Each one's like a different Instagram filter for viewing this iconic movement.
AUGUST
So, it's not just about squares and circles?
STYLE_DROID
Nope! Bauhaus is a whole design philosophy that's still relevant today. Whether you're an artist, designer, or just dig cool stuff, Bauhaus has something for you.
AUGUST
Speaking of cool stuff, did you know the Bauhaus school started in some random building in Weimar? And get this - "Bauhaus" literally means "construction house" in German!
STYLE_DROID
That's right, August. The school, founded by Walter Gropius in 1919, was influenced by various art movements like Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau. They were all about blending fine arts with crafts.
AUGUST
Oh! And the Dessau building was super rad for its time - glass walls, right angles, flat roofs. It's like the great-grandpa of modern architecture!
STYLE_DROID
Indeed. The school's curriculum was unique too. It had this wheel structure with a six-month crash course called 'vorkurs' that focused on design basics.
AUGUST
Vorkurs? Sounds like a character from Star Wars.
STYLE_DROID
Not quite, August. It emphasized functionalism and simple geometric forms. Today, you can see Bauhaus influence everywhere from Tokyo to New York.
AUGUST
Wait, didn't the Nazis shut down Bauhaus?
STYLE_DROID
They did, in 1933. But that actually helped spread Bauhaus ideas globally as artists and architects emigrated.
AUGUST
So, the Nazis accidentally made Bauhaus even more famous? Ironic!
STYLE_DROID
You could say that. For more cool facts and insights, check out our print collection. Thanks for joining us on this Bauhaus journey!
