angrily for sure. i have used an app to scrape clean my reddit and twitter three times now. it wasn't pretty. i was like hype and like in those days it was frustraiting to be ahead of things to that degree because there was nothing to work with. i just had to beg for the tools i needed. smooze startups into letting me test their product or let them build their product according to my needs as a way for them to build out their product

the funny thing is that all these startups were not building smart. like somehow even back then i knew what NOT to build like it was obvious what would be coming down the line soon enough. but all the tools i  nagged for and those startups -- they are absoultely out of business long ago by now lol 

BUT i suppose that is how it is for all of our projects. we hop from project to project. other people are better at getting their stuff out in front of people faster than i am. i mean we have all those mvp, but until i have a job we won't really know how fast i can get stuff out in front of people 

-- you know what would be fascinating, is if there is a way to like hack out of a computer how many hours it has been operational over the past X amount of time. Because I guarantee the amount of time I've been spending on the computer and working for two years now would be so intense that I would have to be careful about who I told. Like people would be worried and not think it is healthy. Not that I'd care because the are the same people who aren't dropping everything to learn about how ai fits into their lives. Which is just crazy to me I mean it took this long, two years, and it is only now starting to come into share how I might turn this into value. And like, it isn't even as if it is one idea. We have literal lists of ideas. And like, I lucked out in that no one wants to hire people who don't know AI.
