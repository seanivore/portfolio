PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND WORKFLOW

# Available Tools

## File Operations
- read_file: View contents of existing files
- write_to_file: Create new files or completely overwrite existing ones
- replace_in_file: Make targeted changes to existing files
- list_files: Explore directory contents
- search_files: Find specific content across files

## Visual Testing
- browser_action: Preview and test pages
- launch: Open page in browser
- click: Interact with elements
- type: Input text
- scroll_up/down: Navigate page
- close: Close browser
  Note: Must launch browser first, perform one action per message, and close when done
  Note: User may do first review to expedite things and avoid sometimes costly browser token use

## Git Operations
- git tools for publishing changes to GitHub Pages

# Project Structure
/Users/seanivore/Projects/portfolio-clean/
├── projects/          # HTML/CSS files for each entry
├── assets/entries/    # Images and other media
├── assets/tile image and thumbnails/    #Design Asset Images
└── index.html         # Main portfolio page with project grid

# Workflow Rules (These are for when creating a new project entry only) 
1. Work from /Users/seanivore/Projects directory
2. Edit new entries in portfolio-clean/projects/
3. Maintain consistent styling with existing entries
4. Pause between projects to check in
5. Have user review instead of browser operation for initial reviews
6. Push to GitHub when complete

# File Naming 
- HTML: [project-planned-slug].html
- CSS: [project-planned-slug].css
- Assets: portfolio-clean/assets/entries/[project-planned-slug]/

# Best Practices
1. Check existing entries for style consistency
2. Use replace_in_file for small changes
3. Use write_to_file for new files
4. Test layout at multiple screen sizes
5. Update index.html project grid in reverse chronological order
