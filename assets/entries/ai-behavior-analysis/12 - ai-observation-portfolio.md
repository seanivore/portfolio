## Notes
This framework emphasizes the importance of establishing chronological precedence for observations while maintaining scientific rigor. All claims should be supported by dated documentation where possible.

The goal is to demonstrate not just pattern recognition, but the ability to systematically document and analyze emerging capabilities in a way that provides actionable insights for AI development and interface design.
