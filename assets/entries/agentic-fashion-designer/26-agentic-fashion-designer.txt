## Creating A Character to Dress On-Trend

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanivore/portfolio/refs/heads/portfolio-seanivore/assets/entries/agentic-fashion-designer/img-01-agentic-fashion-designer.webp

Generative AI creates relatable stories, often drawing inspiration from astrology. Subsequently, multiple AI reviewers analyze these stories, identifying character arcs, climaxes, conflicts, and resolutions. Character profiles are generated, enabling the categorization of archetypes and the prediction of moods based on the narrative. By combining these variables, we can select historical art, general aesthetics, and ultimately, meticulously crafted outfits that push boundaries and create trends almost certain to resonate with audiences.

### The Prompts

## Finding Connections, Mood, Inspiration

When the previous automation is complete with production, review, editing drafts, and sorting by archetypal characters, this next automation with nine separate AI entities is triggered. 

A substantial amount of written content is reviewed at the start — the overall narrative containing all the various archetypes situated in their story arcs. Then a line of up to ten AI review the narrative to identify and produce the needed content for each archetype so that fashion photographs can be produced. These are sent directly to the appropriate section of the database for each archetype. 

### The Prompts

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanivore/portfolio/refs/heads/portfolio-seanivore/assets/entries/agentic-fashion-designer/img-05-agentic-fashion-designer.webp

Archetypes, historic art movements, and narratives that mark life milestones are combined by AI to identify relationships and patterns between identifiers. These patterns are then used to create avant-garde, on-trend fashion outfits that cater to the subject's needs, fostering personal growth and self-discovery. 

## Character Profile + Circumstance = Tastes + Needs

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanivore/portfolio/refs/heads/portfolio-seanivore/assets/entries/agentic-fashion-designer/img-06-agentic-fashion-designer.webp

Analysis of an archetypal character's place in 'time' in the story — what they're going through, the influences coming from them and being placed on them — makes it possible to presume what their tastes would be in general, and in flux from life events. 

[image, regular or narrow content wrap; alt: Film Noir Femme Fatale Fashionista in Silk - no caption] 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanivore/portfolio/refs/heads/portfolio-seanivore/assets/entries/agentic-fashion-designer/img-25-agentic-fashion-designer.webp

This information leads the AI to determine enough of a mood to choose a historic Art Movement. Synthesizing all these details makes it possible to create a realistic 'Vision' for the character profiled and a goal based on what they're going through. The goal works to ensure we design an outfit that, in some way, helps the character get from where they are to where they need to be. 

### The Prompts

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanivore/portfolio/refs/heads/portfolio-seanivore/assets/entries/agentic-fashion-designer/img-07-agentic-fashion-designer.webp

This is the core of the recipe for producing truly desirable, relatable attire. It is a very form-follows-function approach that is then put through the two lenses of art history aesthetic and, of course, the current fashion trends that are up and coming. 

## Composing The Written Outfit Designs

All the elements needed for the final outfit design prompt have now been created. No need to compile them into the prompt manually, however. All the details are in the database. The AI will pull from the database, review the required prompt information to create the final outfit, and write you a much better prompt than a human could write — as long as you have a secondary AI there to review the work, that is. 

### Prompt Creation & Running The Prompt

[image, narrow content wrap; alt: Final Outfit Production] 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanivore/portfolio/refs/heads/portfolio-seanivore/assets/entries/agentic-fashion-designer/img-09-agentic-fashion-designer.webp

A secondary AI to review the prompt, and then a third AI to provide the finished prompt to. With that, the completed outfit description is complete and put back in the database so that the next phase — photoshoots — is ready to begin. 

## Modern Fashion \"Sketching\" Drafts

The final outfit prompt comes in a defined structure that ensures you have multiple items to choose from. The first phase of what would probably be a first draft of actual pencil on paper before the most cutting-edge technology is actually the \"Photoshoot.\" 

### Generative AI Photoshoot

Mixing around the flow of the provided outfit text and running it with a perfected formulaic structure crafted for our chosen tool — Adobe Firefly — we now produce and save countless images. 

Claude really is THAT good at writing extremely detailed, carefully worded, written outfit text. You'll immediately be able to tell that the results are a winner. However, since these are straight from the AI Image Generator, they are merely a guide. Trust us, they look better small and from afar than close up — crazy faces, random limbs, all the fun AI Image things. But that is okay, this is just the first draft or \"sketch\" of our outfits. 

[twelve 1000px by 400px images, use wide content wrap and stack the images with very narrow gap in between each, this is intended to me more of an artsy visual effect, and not intended to really try to show outfits; alt: AI Generated Fashion Photoshoot Images]

As much as we might fall in love with one of the models, outfits, or other aspects of the first draft sketch photoshoot images, it is inevitable that the entire image will, in the end, be overwritten. Sometimes it is possible to save a piece of clothing if you really love it, but really these are just a guide to build the second sketch on top of, covering their faces, the backgrounds, and their outfits. 

### Generative Fill

That's where the final sketch step comes in. Using \"Generative Fill\" in Adobe Photoshop is strangely like sketching in the way you layer and replace things. You just keep on altering the image until you can just feel that it is perfect and complete.

## Automated Digital Image Management 

The two \"sketching\" steps are the most human-intensive aspects of the process — and the most fun. From here on out, images and other text assets needed for publication are generated in automations that trigger each other, one after another. 

### Edits, File-Types, Even Alt. Image Text

When this flow is triggered, it will review images with Vision AI and then manage the media according to what is needed. 

The flow has multiple AI checkpoints where captions, descriptions, titles, and other text needed for the content being produced is composed. It also automatically makes all necessary edits of the image by cropping and resizing a proper thumbnail share image, hero image, as well as landscape and portrait versions, saving each in both .JPG and .WEBP formats. Lastly, the automation categorizes and tags the image if needed, saving it to embeddings to be easily found by AI to produce content using brand art or fashion photos in future content production with accuracy. 

### Final Lookbook Publication

Having prepared generative copy and organized it in the database with appropriate photoshoot images, this automation simply locates those assets and applies them to a webpage template design in your CMS system using API. Our lookbooks both have more than 50 pages!

## Conclusions [just the last bit goes in the .conclusions tag]

There are of course many different improvements to be made each time this system is used. And the prompts are always adjusted a bit — except for the final one, that one is perfection and provided by Anthropic directly. This process of optimizing and adjusting *should* never end if you're doing it right. Just when you think it is \"perfect\" the type of content desired will change. That's just the nature of Product Marketing and Fashion Design. Guaranteed this will be part of what the entire industry will be doing in a matter of months, as I write this on 14 January 2025. 

The future of fashion lies in this harmonious blend of AI-driven narrative analysis and human creative direction, where technology doesn't replace artistic vision but rather amplifies it to new heights.
