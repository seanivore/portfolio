Again, this post is meant to lean a bit into how Make is a great stepping stone — both to help others but also to prop myself up was having grown past it without having to specifically say that; its just implied by my / us speaking in this way. 

We should mention that there is another post that thoroughly goes through about 75 photographs of the 100+ or so that both the 1st Edition Summer 2024 Lookbook and the 2nd Edition Winter 2024-2025 Lookbook each have, talking about the process from a more strategic standpoint regarding the narrative and how it played into building characters with moods, motives, needs, and thus inherently creating fashionable outfits to fit this character profile and their character arc must be relatable. Let's explain that all here as well in directing them to go check that one out. Particularly because, based on what these scenarios are doing, they should draw intrigue to learn more about the system used. 

This post consists of all the various automations and AI that work together to create, compile, and present the massive amount of fashion information that each lookbook includes. It might be noted that, even with all the automations, it still takes me a month. This makes sense because normally producing something of such a high quality, so on trend, and — though frankly never even going to very deep into touching the human experience with our fashion design — is a something that takes a large team, a lot of money, and multiple months of work. 

So this post will still be strategic, but in this case it is more about how the tools were leveraged to make this happen. It might also be worth noting that, even while I knew there were many other ways to create automations, that, perhaps because my early first decade of my career was in a non-profit, I really went all out in learning about and utilizing my resources. 

And for added enjoyment, the scenarios, which if I don't get a chance to detail its operation in more than a few sentences per scenario, please get me started and tap me in for specifics — but they'll all be separated by fashionable photo prints of Femme Fatale women from the Film Noir art movement era.
