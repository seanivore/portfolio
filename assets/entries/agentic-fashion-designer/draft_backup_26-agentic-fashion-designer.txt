Again, this post is meant to lean a bit into how Make is a great stepping stone — both to help others but also to prop myself up was having grown past it without having to specifically say that; its just implied by my / us speaking in this way. 

We should mention that there is another post that thoroughly goes through about 75 photographs of the 100+ or so that both the 1st Edition Summer 2024 Lookbook and the 2nd Edition Winter 2024-2025 Lookbook each have, talking about the process from a more strategic standpoint regarding the narrative and how it played into building characters with moods, motives, needs, and thus inherently creating fashionable outfits to fit this character profile and their character arc must be relatable. Let's explain that all here as well in directing them to go check that one out. Particularly because, based on what these scenarios are doing, they should draw intrigue to learn more about the system used. 

This post consists of all the various automations and AI that work together to create, compile, and present the massive amount of fashion information that each lookbook includes. It might be noted that, even with all the automations, it still takes me a month. This makes sense because normally producing something of such a high quality, so on trend, and — though frankly never even going to very deep into touching the human experience with our fashion design — is a something that takes a large team, a lot of money, and multiple months of work. 

So this post will still be strategic, but in this case it is more about how the tools were leveraged to make this happen. It might also be worth noting that, even while I knew there were many other ways to create automations, that, perhaps because my early first decade of my career was in a non-profit, I really went all out in learning about and utilizing my resources. 

And for added enjoyment, the scenarios, which if I don't get a chance to detail its operation in more than a few sentences per scenario, please get me started and tap me in for specifics — but they'll all be separated by fashionable photo prints of Femme Fatale women from the Film Noir art movement era. 

Obviously please arrange the visuals around as you see best fit.

Primary Narrative Composition
Generative Al creates relatable stories, often drawing inspiration from astrology.
Subsequently, numerous Al reviewers analyze the stories, identifying character arcs, climaxes, conflicts, and resolutions. Character profiles are generated, enabling the categorization of archetypes and the prediction of moods based on the narrative. By combining these variables, we can select historical art, general aesthetics, and eventually, meticulously crafted outfits that push boundaries and create trends that are almost certain to resonate with audiences.

--> A flow that reviews images with Vision AI and then manages the media according to what is needed. The flow has multiple AI check-points where captions, descriptions, titles, and other text needed for the content being produced is composed. It also automatically makes all necessary edits of the image by cropping and resizing a proper thumbnail share image, hero image, as well as landscape and portrait versions, saving each in both .JPG and .WEBP formats. Lastly, the automation categorizes and tags the image if needed, saving it to embeddings to be easily found by AI to produce content using brand art or fashion photos in future content production with accuracy.

--> Archetypes, historic art movements, and narratives that mark life milestones are combined by Al to identify relationships and patterns between identifiers. These patterns are then used to create avant-garde, on-trend fashion outfits that cater to the subject's needs, fostering personal growth and self-discovery. 

A good deal of written content is reviewed at the start — the overall narrative containing all the various archetypes situated in their story arcs. Then a line of up to ten AI review the narrative to identify and produce the needed content for each archetypes so that fashion photographs can be produced. These are sent directly to the appropriate section of the database for each archetype.
