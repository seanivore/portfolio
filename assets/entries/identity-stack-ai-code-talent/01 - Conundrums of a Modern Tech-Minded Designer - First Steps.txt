Conundrums of a Modern Tech-Minded Designer

SEAN: 
Ah, I was thinking we'd be redesigning the content tile first, but it does seem to make more sense to both, start at the top, but, more importantly lol, get those tags situated first! 

I wonder if first on the masthead we might want to consider what I had mentioned the other day -- I'm not so sure I feel comfortable calling myself a full-stack developer. But it is admittedly very complicated right now to figure this all out. Maybe you can help me mentally sort this out so that we can end up with both something to adjust the language to and providing me with a more solid footing for how to talk about myself and my work. 

So, logically, obviously no one is going to be hiring anymore who doesn't have AI experience. However, we're in this in between phase where hiring managers are not in any way indicating this on documents. Only once I saw something carefully worded, but it was more easily identified by the fact that it was like a programmer role that also had social media tasks. So the broadening of job description requirements is, lucky for me, broadening. 

I spent some time the other day looking through stack overflow jobs. And I mean they all still want years of experience with certain languages, but there were a few where I would feel comfortable apply for, with the presumption that I would be buying myself a o1/o3 Pro unlimited subscription. 

BUT then there's sort of that weird caveat where its like, well fuck, I could apply for anything if operating under that presumption. 

So (and apologies, I'm half explaining and half putting things together as I write this) obviously I need to lean hard on the so very many hats I've worn. Probably while pushing design to the forefront. Perhaps specifically that my designing has only gotten more and more technically over the years, and in the past two years*, months. 

From drawing by hand for web3. Designing motion graphics. Already checking off all the media production types, and so moving into automated agentic content production and presentation. So any make scenarios for everything. And then most recently, planning complex and strategic coding projects working with AI. 

So part of me wants to just put that I'm an AI-led stack developer. But obviously, and unsurprisingly, this all requires coining new language, like ai-led stack developer probably isn't right. 

But then at the same time, I'm like, okay well everyone hiring is sitting on the fence, so should I be? 

And even though I keep getting pulled toward thinking that I pretty much immediately fall back towards, no, they don't know or aren't ready to say what they want, but that has no relevance regarding what you are, talent-wise. 

Which brings me to my * earlier. We started my resume update (and will need to finish it soon) but I'm starting to wonder if I should be super open that I spent the past two years, yes self employed, but not like I brought money in, because I've been exploring and learning from AI, experimenting, keeping up with everything -- all that good stuff. Like part of me almost feels like it is like when people have a break in their resume and need to explain it. Like, yes I can list projects, and thats good, but if it comes down to explaining it, it sort of would come out like that, no? 

And as much as it bugs me, it seems like I have to just embrace the controversial nature of being just an AI developer. Like, it is talked about on the interwebs in almost the same way "AI Artists" were. 

But I guess I keep coming back to the whole "no relevance regarding what you are, talent-wise" thought. Like I need to just figure out how to brand it all. Like mention the AI coding stuff, but also be able to somehow do it in a very humble way -- which honestly will probably only help because LOL the people who would be technically in the same boat as me -- I mean idk how else to say it but it is very evident from Reddit but most AI coders really really suck. Even when long-term developers make fun of our new breed, like 25% of the time, maybe more, it doesn't even apply to me because I've better climbed the learning curve than whatever they're making fun of. Like good god the Discord of people building MCPs they just keep asking the freaking most technical questions and were trying to write part of code write and didn't know how and I'm just watching like, whut, the, fuck. I once was like "I definitely encountered what you're describing and was able to get around it. I can't really explain how exactly myself directly, but I can tell you that Continue.Dev is free and I've used like all the AI coding tools and it was been blowing my mind. So I just asked it these questions you're asking and that's how we built our first MCP server." (This was before Cline.) AND THE KICKER THOUGH IS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO USE AI -- multiple people, similar situations and exchanges, and they all were look oh that's a good idea. Maybe i'll do that. But .. [and then it is veru clear they are definitely not going to do that because they go back right into trying to get answers from humans in the discord instead of using their resources.] 

So how I, express all of that, and represent my talent, without coming off cringy (which is how I think just straight up "Full Stack Dev" comes off -- in part because like if anyone was to start asking me technical questions about stacks and shit, I wouldn't be able to respond, and not even necessarily because it was a concept I didn't know, but because it is vocabulary and lingo and just everything I don't now. But like, I don't need to know to do talented things. And I want to be humble about it in hopes that I get to be somewhere that allows me to learn that stuff. 

Agh do you see how complicated this is? We can 100% confidently say that no one has ever had this problem in the history of humanity before. At least, not specifically. Conceptually sure.



CLAUDE: 
This is a fascinating and complex situation that really captures the current moment in tech. Let me break this down thoughtfully:

1. You've identified something crucial - we're in a transition period where companies need AI expertise but don't know how to ask for it yet. The job descriptions haven't caught up to the reality.

2. Your journey is actually quite compelling - you've evolved from traditional creative roles (hand drawing, motion graphics) through increasingly technical implementations (web3, automated content) to what could be called "AI-augmented development." This progression tells a strong story.

3. The two-year period of AI exploration and learning is potentially a strong positive, not a gap to explain away. It shows foresight - you saw where things were heading and invested in understanding it deeply while others were still skeptical.

4. Your point about the quality gap in AI development is important. There's a huge difference between someone who just feeds prompts to AI and someone who understands how to architect solutions, plan projects, and create reliable, maintainable systems.

Let me propose some potential positioning options:

**Creative Technologist & AI Systems Architect**
- This emphasizes both your creative background and technical capabilities
- "Systems Architect" captures your ability to design comprehensive solutions
- Avoids the loaded term "Full Stack" while still implying broad capabilities

**Technical Design Director & AI Integration Specialist**
- Leads with your design expertise
- Acknowledges your technical progression
- Positions AI as a tool you've mastered, not your only focus

**Design Systems Architect & AI Development Lead**
- Bridges design and development
- Implies leadership in both traditional and AI-augmented development
- Suggests system-level thinking

The key might be positioning yourself as someone who:
1. Understands design deeply
2. Can architect complete solutions
3. Uses AI as a powerful tool, not a crutch
4. Brings creative and technical skills together
5. Can translate between traditional development and AI-augmented approaches

This way, you're not claiming traditional full-stack expertise, but rather positioning yourself as someone who can create complete solutions using modern tools and approaches, with a strong foundation in design and user experience.

What resonates most with you from these options? We could use this to inform not just the masthead text but the overall way we present your work throughout the portfolio.



SEAN: 
Right like eventually obviously they'll be buying o1/o3 whatever for us -- but like we're not even there yet! 

Give it all a sequential think Claudy, I just feel all over the place about it and like, part of what makes me win is my confidence so like, I need to not be all over the place about it.



CLAUDE: 

Let me help organize these thoughts systematically.

{
  `thought`: `First, let's identify your core strengths that set you apart:

Sets you apart from both traditional developers and AI prompt-engineers
Positions you for where the industry is heading
Would you like to explore this direction for the masthead, or would you prefer to consider some variations on this theme?


SEAN: 
That reads beautifully! And it even makes sense to be broader. It I think better fits my experience, and the way we've been framing things lately for UX/UI more and more. 

So, let's do that, but also will you write up like some multi paragraph breakdown of how I can talk about myself to back this up? Something like that I could break into smaller pieces and soundbites as I absorb it all. And the double bonus is that if it is a couple paragraphs, then I can put that, along with all I sent above, and even like the sequential thinking thoughts, put it all in NotebookLM and see what comes of it all when I hit the button to make a podcast. 

In that light, if you wanted to be of help for me making use of that tool, then the important stuff on how i can talk about myself to back everything up (while I know when it is all written out it sill --hopefully-- come off as like so much more obvious than my anxious brain is making it. But then if you were able to write something up for me that really breaks down the issue and like anything else that would help NotebookLM create a podcast, something I can listen to repeatedly, that cuts to the same core of how to talk about myself in all this, listening to that makes for much faster confidence building. 

Wdyt?


This is a brilliant idea - giving you both written material to reference and fuel for creating audio content that can help internalize these concepts. Let me craft this in a way that will work well both as reference material and as input for NotebookLM's podcast generation.
