Building a Local File Preview MCP Server for Claude
Overview
In under an hour and for just $3.03 in API costs, we developed a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude to preview and analyze local HTML files. This tool bridges a critical gap in Claude's capabilities, allowing it to visually inspect web pages it helps create.

Development Approach
The development process followed a systematic path:

Core Implementation

Built on the MCP SDK for standardized communication
Integrated Puppeteer for headless browser control
Implemented file system operations for local access
Feature Development

Screenshot capture with full CSS styling
HTML structure analysis
Local file path handling
Screenshot management system
Technical Challenges & Solutions
Challenge 1: Local Resource Access
Initially, we faced issues with CSS file loading when using file:// URLs. The solution involved:

Reading CSS files directly from the filesystem
Injecting styles programmatically using Puppeteer's page.addStyleTag
Handling relative paths for resources
Challenge 2: Environment Integration
We encountered path resolution issues with __dirname in ES modules. We resolved this by:

Implementing absolute path handling
Creating a dedicated screenshots directory
Ensuring proper file system permissions
Results
The final implementation provides:

Full-page screenshots of HTML files with proper styling
Detailed HTML structure analysis
Seamless integration with Claude OS and Cline
Open-source availability for community use
Impact
This tool significantly enhances Claude's web development capabilities:

Direct visual feedback on HTML changes
Automated structure analysis
Local file preview without external servers
Improved development workflow efficiency
Time & Cost Efficiency
Development Time: Under 1 hour
Total Cost: $3.03
Result: A fully functional MCP server that extends Claude's capabilities
The project demonstrates how quickly and cost-effectively custom tools can be developed to enhance AI capabilities, particularly in local development scenarios.
