Art Deco, a style of visual arts, architecture, and design that first appeared in France just before World War I, has made a resurgent mark in contemporary interior design. Known for its rich colors, bold geometry, and decadent detail work, Art Deco epitomizes modern luxury with a stylistic nod to the past.

Signature art pieces with bold geometrical designs serve as magnificent centerpieces that dictate the sophisticated yet inviting mood of a room, allowing for a seamless flow of contemporary luxe and vintage glam.
