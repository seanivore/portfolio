1. **Open Plan:**
    - Refers to a layout where multiple rooms, typically the living room, dining area, and kitchen, are combined into one larger space without separating walls.
2. **Traditional Layout:**
    - Refers to a layout where rooms are separated by walls, with distinct spaces for each function such as living room, dining room, and kitchen.
3. **Loft-style:**
    - Refers to a layout that features high ceilings, large open spaces, and often industrial elements like exposed beams or pipes. Lofts typically have minimal interior walls, creating a spacious and flexible living area.
4. **Split-level:**
    - Refers to a layout where different areas of the home are located on multiple levels, with short flights of stairs separating them. This can create visual interest and define separate living zones within the same space.
5. **Studio/Single-room:**

6. **Duplex/Triplex:**

7. **Open-air/Indoor-outdoor living:**
    - Refers to a layout that blurs the boundaries between indoor and outdoor spaces, often with large windows, sliding glass doors, or outdoor patios and decks that seamlessly connect to interior living areas.
8. **Compact/Cozy:**
    - Refers to a layout that maximizes the efficient use of space in smaller homes or apartments, with multifunctional rooms and clever storage solutions to accommodate daily living needs.
