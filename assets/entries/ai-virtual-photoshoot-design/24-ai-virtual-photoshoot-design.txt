This project, initiated in June 2024, marked a pivotal moment in my understanding of AI's potential for creative project management. What began as an ambitious attempt to create "Apartment Therapy"-style content around art history aesthetics turned into a revelation about AI's capability to handle complex, multi-faceted creative projects – months before dedicated AI project management tools even existed.

The scope was intentionally challenging: create an Art Deco-themed virtual photoshoot, produce a video, and develop blog content, all while maintaining a cohesive narrative thread. Truly, I had never even considered the possibility of directing a virtual photoshoot before this project – it seemed like something far outside my capabilities. But as the AI began organizing the shoot, planning the angles, and suggesting compositions, what initially felt overwhelming quickly transformed into a masterclass in AI-driven project management, as GPT Assistant simultaneously handled photoshoot planning, video scripting, and content strategy with remarkable efficiency.

Our protagonist's story evolved organically through collaboration with the AI. Meet Alexa, a Leo with a love for glamour and Art Deco style, who had just landed a major promotion at her advertising agency. A creative director with impeccable taste and a keen eye for blending modern and vintage styles, she brought her professional expertise home to her DTLA penthouse loft. Her space needed to reflect both her vibrant personality – complete with tasteful sleeve tattoos and a love for lace – and her sophisticated professional life, where she was known for crafting campaigns as bold and memorable as her living space.

CAPTION: Wide shot of Alexa's primary living area, a contemporary art deco room with a high rise floor to ceiling window. 

The creative direction process, particularly in image selection, demonstrated the importance of professional judgment in AI collaboration. Our primary selections centered on spaces that balanced luxury with believability:

CAPTION: Hip, contemporary tropical-core Art Deco master bedroom finished with green painted woodwork and lace. 

The bedroom perfectly captured our refined Art Deco vision, with its sophisticated green paneling and geometric headboard creating a space that felt both aspirational and attainable. Similar balance was achieved in the transformed apothecary table area:

CAPTION: Antique collection of decor and liquor bottles all of fine crystal on a trendy apothecary table style small in-home bar space. 

This space exemplifies how we worked with unexpected AI outputs – while we had initially envisioned an apothecary table (a playful nod to Friends), the AI produced this stunning bar area. Rather than forcing our original concept, we embraced this more sophisticated interpretation.

CAPTION: Truly on-trend painted blue and intricate gold wall ornaments creating a large but cozy space to work from home. 

The workspace represents another successful adaptation, where contemporary functionality meets Art Deco glamour without sacrificing believability.

Our secondary selections focused on contemporary realistic spaces that grounded the narrative:

CAPTION: Green painted walls, vaulted ceiling, and more lace on this guest bedroom with large penthouse windows showing Downtown Los Angeles.

CAPTION: Very contemporary primary living room space with classic DTLA loft cement walls as well as classic Art Deco wall decorations, with more natural light, of course. 

These spaces helped balance the more opulent primary selections, creating a cohesive story of luxury that remained within the realm of possibility for a successful advertising executive's DTLA penthouse.

The project required careful navigation of various AI-generated options. While some spaces were stunningly opulent:

CAPTION: Wide shot of a living area that was a bit too much for Alexa's space, but opulent and gorgeous nonetheless.

CAPTION: Focus on another gigantic room, too large for Alexa's space, but displaying the stunning lighting figures that are as classic to the era as they are trendy.

CAPTION: Overhead view of a very large dining area; Alex'a opted for an additional living room instead of a dining room, though it was a hard choice. 

We had to make strategic decisions about which spaces to include. Multiple grand living rooms would have stretched the narrative's credibility, even for a penthouse setting. This selective curation process demonstrated how human creative direction can shape AI outputs into cohesive storytelling.
