            <p class="project-summary">
                Despite generating over 3 billion impressions through viral marketing strategies at PETA, I found myself facing an invisible barrier in traditional corporate environments. The breakthrough in understanding my neurodivergent thinking pattern came from an unexpected source: my interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs).

        <h2 class="section-header">Parallel Processing & Pattern Recognition</h2>
        <p>Working with AI systems revealed striking parallels between LLM architecture and neurodivergent thinking patterns:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Multi-threading cognitive processes similar to transformer model attention heads</li>
            <li>Rapid pattern recognition across disparate domains</li>
            <li>Intuitive leaps that compress multiple logical steps</li>
            <li>Non-linear information processing and synthesis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These similarities helped explain both my professional strengths and communication challenges. While my mind could make quantum leaps between concepts, I often skipped dozens of intermediate steps that neurotypical thinkers needed for context.</p>
