# Portfolio System

Hey there! üëã I'm Sean, a design systems architect exploring the intersection of creative innovation and technical development. This portfolio is built on a modular system that reflects my approach to solving complex challenges.

## System Overview

The portfolio uses a component-based architecture that prioritizes:
- Clean, semantic HTML5 with modern CSS
- Zero-dependency performance optimization
- Dynamic content relationships
- Automated build and deployment with Jekyll

### Visual System

I wanted the portfolio to be both visually engaging and technically sound, so I built it around:

- **Modular Components**: Everything from hero sections to image galleries is built using reusable, pre-styled components. This keeps the codebase clean and makes adding new content a breeze.

- **Smart Spacing System**: Visual hierarchy is managed through a systematic approach to spacing, using predefined content widths and section spacing to maintain consistency across all pages.

- **Responsive Design**: The system automatically adapts layouts and image handling based on content type and screen size, ensuring a great experience across all devices.

### Content Relationships

One of the more interesting technical challenges was creating meaningful connections between projects. The solution:

- **Dynamic Tag System**: Projects are linked through a weighted scoring algorithm that considers both primary and secondary tags
- **Category Multipliers**: Different content categories (like AI Development or Systems Architecture) have specific weight multipliers
- **Smart Related Content**: The system automatically surfaces relevant projects based on shared concepts and technical approaches

### Technical Implementation

Some key technical decisions that shaped the system:

- **Chart Integration**: Flexible chart implementation supporting both simple data visualization and complex TSX-based charts
- **Image Optimization**: Systematic approach to handling different image types (including GIFs) with GitHub-based CDN delivery
- **Build Process**: Automated build system that handles URL optimization and content relationships

### Development Philosophy

The system reflects my approach to development:
- Start with a strong foundation of reusable components
- Build in flexibility for future expansion
- Optimize for both user experience and developer workflow
- Document thoroughly but keep it practical

## Under the Hood

For those interested in the technical details:
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Modern CSS with custom properties
- Dynamic JavaScript for content relationships
- Jekyll for clean URLs and build optimization
- GitHub Pages for reliable hosting
