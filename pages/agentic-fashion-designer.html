And the prompts are always adjusted a bit — except for the final one, that one is perfection and provided by Anthropic directly. This process of optimizing and adjusting <em>should</em> never end if you're doing it right. Just when you think it is "perfect" the type of content desired will change. That's just the nature of Product Marketing and Fashion Design. Guaranteed this will be part of what the entire industry will be doing in a matter of months, as I write this on 14 January 2025.</p>
