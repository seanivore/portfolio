            <p>The hard truth is, that's what they want you to think. As I write this, 9 January 2025, managers are barely comfortable putting the need for experience using AI on job descriptions. Even in engineering and graphic design. But if you're someone who does either, you know that AI is already fully part of your process.</p>

            <p>Can you convince yourself that they would hire someone without extensive experience with AI?

        <div class="content-wrap">
            <p>Put plainly: the means and methods of production, distribution, and consumption have already rapidly changed, more than once in over two years. Imagine you're a hiring manager. Frankly, it is better that you think it is impossible to create an automated marketing department worth its chops, because it could buy them a year, maybe more, before everyone realizes that companies are only hiring a tenth of their prior staff. It only makes sense to play with that timeline if you can, because eventually the surplus labor, outside of the small amount that is required, will end up creating more businesses. Now, we're not going to go down the rabbit hole working through why that is a logically sound statement, you're just going to have to trust that it is human nature to expand, to explore, to create, to trade, to collect, socialize, communicate, travel... you get the picture. There is no removing that aspect of humanity. I challenge you to come up with one truly plausible reason. Because you know that you're not lazy, you're disinterested. You're not addicted to your job, you're addicted to being productive. We've framed these things in a negative light for so long that it is sometimes hard to see the core truth that is who and what it means to be human. AI art looks to "realistic"? We'll start craving art we can tell is human made. We'll create spaces to experience the production of art. Years of "photoshop trickery" is making people only think about things from one side.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I could go on and on but the point here is to break down exactly how automation of a marketing department can be done, as well as what the small but significant details are that make it work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-wrap">
            <p>Two years ago I set out to create a brand. The plan was to build out one media and medium channel, then automate it. Optimize it. Then manage it while moving to build out another media and medium channel to be automated, and so on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-wrap">
            <p>Since then I've done it with multiple brands, falling into mediums I never expected to be able to fully automate. As always in marketing, the game however will forever be changing, but now it will be a new game. It will be a game of creating what it is that humans are seeking out to consume *because they see humanity in it*. Thus the success of NotebookLM's podcasts. The obsession with "realistic" generative pictures of humans, as if anyone ever kept the picture of the models in the picture frame they bought at the department store. It's a means to an end; a desire to see it done. Then, much like humans have always done, we'll be on to something new. This has always been the marketing game. We've just swapped out the tools.</p>

            <p>I've you've read that missive and want more, proceed to review the strategic AI implementation, from content creation to automated newsletters and social media, revealing a blueprint for scaling operations while maintaining strategic control and creative quality. The kicker is, you've already been falling for it for over a year, possibly years at this point. Time to get in on the game because things are about to get really crazy out there. Crazy in the best way.</p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="content-wrap">
            <p>Let's start with something most consultants won't tell you about implementing AI in your marketing department: you don't need to start with expensive tools or a team of engineers. That's often exactly the wrong approach. What you need is a systematic way to learn and grow with the technology.</p>

            <h2>Starting Smart: The Power of Accessible Tools</h2>
            <p>Two years ago, we built a complete AI-powered marketing department from the ground up. Not with complex custom code or expensive enterprise solutions, but by starting with accessible tools that let our entire team understand and participate in the automation process. Today, I'm going to show you exactly how we did it, and more importantly, how you can do it too.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-wrap">
            <p>We started with Make.com - not because it was the only option, but because it's user-friendly, cost-effective, and powerful enough to handle serious automation scenarios. When teams are first exploring AI implementation, they often make the mistake of jumping straight to custom development or expensive enterprise solutions. This usually leads to two problems: limited team understanding and reduced ability to iterate quickly.</p>

            <h2>Key Learning: AI's Natural Language Understanding</h2>
            <p>Here's what we discovered about working with AI language models, starting with the logic: Uh, they have gigantic vocabularies. So large the tiniest differences in words we'd never think would change anything, could make all the difference in the world in a prompt. Seriously, if the AI kept generating a paragraph instead of one sentence, we'd just ask the AI to alter the prompt so that it didn't write more than one sentence. The change it made was virtually never "write one sentence" — it would be just word choice and maybe even shortening the actual prompt itself. Things that humans just wouldn't think would have a better effect than saying "don't write a paragraph. That's like telling an LLM not to use emojis. Chances are it'll start using them like crazy. It is a stream of consciousness. It cannot forget things at request. This seemingly simple difference in cognition has profound results. So yeah, let the AI write its own directions and just provide feedback. Game. Changer.</p>
